    <desc>Approaching two decades as one of the internet's premier MUDs!</desc>
    <desc>Welcome friend! Come immerse yourself in one of the largest and most advanced online games in existence. With thousands of players, tens of thousands of rooms, hundred of areas, dozens of quests and a billion possibilities, 3Kingdoms offers you endless worlds of adventure!</desc>
    <desc>Simple enough to learn, yet complex enough to challenge you for years, 3Kingdoms is a colossal adventure through which many years of active and continued development by its dedicated coding staff has grown to be one of the best MUDs you will ever play.</desc>
    <desc>Based around the mighty town of Pinnacle, three main realms beckon the player to explore. These kingdoms are known as: Fantasy, a vast medieval realm full of orcs, elves, dragons, and a myriad of other creatures; Science, a post-apocalyptic, war-torn world set in the not-so-distant future; and Chaos, a transient realm where the enormous realities of Fantasy and Science collide to produce creatures so bizarre that they have yet to be categorized.</desc>
    <desc>During their exploration of the realms, players have the opportunity to join any of well over a dozen different guilds. These guilds, like the Knights, Necromancers and Juggernauts and many others, allow the player to become part of a powerful team and gives them a place to socialize with other players. Guilds also grant special, unique powers to the player, furthering their abilities as they explore the vast expanses of each realm. Add in the comprehensive skill system that 3K offers and you are able to customize your characters more than anywhere else.</desc>
    <desc>3Kingdoms combines all these features, and so much more, to give the player an experience that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.  Come live the adventure and find out for yourself why 3K is the best there is!</desc>

    <desc>You wake up sweating, hand on your Armalite AR-15, grit on your face. You haven't bathed in weeks, through the stench on your own body you catch the scent of whatever it is breathing on your matted hair. An animal, but what kind? What size? How mutated?? You better react, like it would matter at this point, if it did matter, you'd be dead.</desc>
    <desc>Letters flash across your vision, assured that your power assisted leggings are charged you flip a twist through the air facing the unknown creature. Rifle on hip, you fire off a clip of 308 rounds in the general direction of the shadow ending the encounter with a thud of it's carcass hitting the desert sands.</desc>
    <desc>Flipping on your combat light reveals it to be a mutated desert yak, you were lucky this time...</desc>
    <desc>The year is around 2100, no one knows the exact year. The war has been over for 75 years yet your war is just starting. You'll have the equipment to make it happen, if you work hard enough. But will you have the guts? You're not in midgaard anymore, you won't find that city here. You'll find nothing familiar here, you're in a new world, a blasted world, and you're all alone. Better find a few friends or you're screwed. Can't be solo and hope to survive much longer, Armalite or not.</desc>
    <desc>Do you have what it takes? Put your money where your mouth is.</desc>
    <desc>Guns, Biogrades, interactive mobiles, original classes, 15000 original 'freeworld' rooms. The only 'stock' parts that remain are the major fight engines and help system to ensure you can hit the ground running day 1.</desc>
    <desc>From the pull of your chainsaw cord, or the blast from your assault rifle.. you'll notice nothing else familiar. Better stock up on friends, and ammo!</desc>

    <desc>Here's an example of one of our combat rounds: You jump up and tuck, letting Scarlock's push kick shoot under you. You deliver a left semi-circular high kick, the instep of your foot connecting with Scarlock's head. Scarlock tosses his head backwards, evading your crescent kick by a fraction. Scarlock snaps his left leg forward hard, slamming it into your midriff. You snap your right elbow viciously into Scarlock's nose. You throw a right roundhouse punch impacting solidly with Scarlock's jaw, making him spit blood! Scarlock blocks your chop with his forarm and jabs you in the face with his free hand. You duck under Scarlock's cross-jab and punch him in the stomach with your right fist, making him cough blood! You smash Scarlock's feeble attack out of the way and taking a powerful step forward you kick him square in the chest sending him flying. Scarlock goes hurtling through the air to the south. Scarlock hits the ground hard. You walk in after him.</desc>

    <desc>Established in 1996, Aardwolf has grown to be a highly popular MUD with several hundred players online at any given time. Featuring a line of sight overhead map, a realistic game world and exploration rankings, Aardwolf is the perfect mud for explorers.</desc>
    <desc>There are 7 high level classes split into 28 subclasses such as enchanters, barbarians, shaman, assassin, etc. Many quests and side games provide entertaining distractions and there is a very active MUD community. Stats actually matter and there are many ways to build your character based on your preferences and style of play.</desc>
    <desc>Real Player killing is optional and restricted (mostly) to clans. There are plenty of other ways to test your skills against others however.</desc>
    <desc>The areas are highly developed. Aardwolf features over 100,000 lines of Lua based area scripts to entertain, challenge and amuse.</desc>
    <desc>As you would expect from a well established MUD, there are many many features. The best introduction to Aardwolf is to drop by and check out our new Academy - an extensive tutorial and quest area. The academy was referred to by one of our newer players as \"The most advanced mud school they have ever seen\".</desc>
    <desc>One thing Aardwolf is not - a serious roleplaying MUD. If that is your preference there are many other fine MUDs for you to try. Our focus is on being a fun place to play, to be challenged when you want to be and take it easy when you don't. Non MUD related chat is not \"tolerated\", it is welcomed. It is, after all, a community.</desc>

    <desc>A hundred and twenty years ago the world was drowned by demon-haunted waves. A few desperate exiles found shelter in the distant Sunset Isles, only to face the savage hordes of native goblinoids. Through merciless warfare, mighty sorceries, and more than a passing share of luck, their descendants have managed to carve a home out of those far shores. Yet the Red Tide remains and the goblins grow stronger in their western mountains, waiting for the hour to take back what they have lost....</desc>
    <desc>Red Tides MUX is a new MUX using the Open Gaming License provided by Wizards of the Coast.

Whether fighting the goblin warbands that raid the human lands, rooting out nefarious Tide Cults, exploring abandoned dwarven holds, or gaming for power in the Mandarin's court, players strive to find places fit for heroes.</desc>

We are finally finished our three month long (and very effective) beta testing period.  We are a hack and slash medieval fantasy MUD, with a modest but polished two thousand room world.  We have fourteen classes, split over two factions (light and dark) and four races.  We run moderated PK and our code is based on a heavily modified CircleMUD 3.1.  We are extremely stable, and haven't had an unresolved crash yet.  We offer 100 challenging mortal levels, but the ladder is very difficult to climb -- so don't expect to get to get to level 100 too fast!  We celebrate our launch with a pwipe to level the playing field for everyone.  So this is your chance to show up first and win the race to the top!</desc>

    <desc>There's roleplaying (optional), quizzes, quests, clans, and are open to suggestion about just about anything you want to do!

We want a MUD where people can enjoy themselves and other aspects of the mud, without compromising gameplay.  Gameplay to us is having rich themes to our areas, various creatures that talk to players instead of just sitting around, and well balanced race/classes.</desc>
    <desc>We have an extended help file system, a newbie chat for those unfamiliar with this kind of MUD, and plenty of friendly imms willing to answer your questions.  There are 16 races and 16 classes each unique with their advantages and disadvantages.  New races and classes are consistently being added and the old ones refined to preserve gameplay. There are also seven cabals, with plans to add more in the future.</desc>
    <desc>We enforce roleplaying here, we like to see players who have unique backgrounds, enjoy being memorable characters, and in turn,  meeting other memorable characters.  We also have mob runned quests that will improve certain aspects of your character.</desc>
    <desc>Although we do encourage player killing, we also discourage senseless slaughter.  We have refined the gameplay so that brains will win over brawn because nobody likes boring hack and slash.  We test our pk ranges thoroughly for fairness. If you enjoy roleplaying in a complex and vast world mixed with the thrills of playerkilling then Abandoned Realms is for you.</desc>

However, Esforonin will also truly encourage roleplaying and storytelling by offering strong coded support for such activities, aswell as hoping to raise a staff dedicated in this direction.</desc>

    <desc>Shamus has finally graduated, and so after a long sabbatical, we are resuming work on Covenant MUD. We are looking for writers interested in helping us continue to build a detailed and atmospheric world. Our central city, Tierceron, is so large it is really a city-state rather than just a city. (For implementors, this means we've got a city with over 1,200 rooms!) Even though the city is very large, we emphasize quality over quantity and strive for originality in everything we implement--from the races and classes to the zones themselves. We highly encourage role-playing, and we do not cater to the lowest common denominator. This isn't to say we are not newbie-friendly, but we are geared toward advanced players. The realm of Covenant is taking shape and we are accepting builders who can write quality, high-impact zones!</desc>
    <desc>We have reverse-engineered and implemented a 'realspace' overworld system similar to what you would find in a BattleTech MUX. Travel between areas has been implemented using a navigation system complete with overland ANSI maps. You set your heading, and how fast you wish to travel (walk, jog, run, or canter, trot, gallop if you are mounted). You can track your progress using various navigation commands. The realspace system adds a genuine sense of distance to the overworld and nicely foils speedwalkers!</desc>

    <desc>** MOVED TO FASTER HOST NOV 2006 ** 207.36.179.112 ** The Abysmal Realms MUD is a Roleplaying/Playerkilling MUD derived from ROM2.4 code.  The Realms opened to the public May 1st, 1997 and has grown steadily since then. Those accustomed to ROM playing will be pleased with the enhancements we've made while still retaining the best of the ROM 'look and feel'. Realism, attention to detail and enhanced user interface have been our top priorities.  The focal point of Abysmal Realms is our clan system. Those new to Role Play will find it natural to fall into RP mode because of the distinct personalities and purposes of each clan. We find best role players often prove to be the first time mudders! We have a clan that is dedicated to life and helping those that are inexperienced learn. Again, you can visit our web site for info on the clans. Though PK is supported, it is judged by strict standards of appropriateness within the RP context maintained here.  We have user-selectable ANSI color, many spam reducing features, and questmasters available for questing anytime. The mud is served by a conscientious and talented staff of immortals. We also have an mprog driven economy, where many things are 'made' by mobs, and we are striving to include every item in the realms in a like manner. Watch as items are picked, gathered, or mined and then processed into foods, weapons, armors, and potions. WE HAVE NOT HAD A PWIPE SINCE OPENING, and do not plan on one in the future.

    <desc>Age of Dragons was originally created in 1996. Since that time the MUD has gone through many changes in order to improve the original world we have created. We now have over 150 zones throughout the MUD, along with three major cities that players of all different alignments call home.</desc>
    <desc>Some of the code we use on Age of Dragons includes a memorization system, where players actually memorize their spells instead of using mana, detailed descriptions for players so that they can customize their characters to the fullest extent, an introduction system which allows players to pick and choose which players they wish to be associated with, and an approval system for new characters that ensures only players with appropriate descriptions and names will be a part of our world.</desc>
    <desc>Numerous different skills and spells from the original and new age of Dungeons and Dragons have been included for players to have at their disposal, we offer eight different races, and eleven different classes to choose from.</desc>
    <desc>Age of Dragons is a MUD like no other. Our originality, ability to obtain unique objects through quests, and rewards for good roleplaying will make Age of Dragons your newest addiction.</desc>

    <desc>AAW is an ever evolving MUD, many new and unique features have been coded into the game. Most MUDS have mprogs, but how many out there offer substantial oprogs and rprogs, so that objects and even rooms can interact with you and your characters actions? We also have an extensive pet system. Pets can be leveled, wear EQ and even have custom names and descriptions.  We also RDL (Room Description Langue) which allows builders the ability to make it so that room descriptions (and other things) say one thing in daytime and another at night, or to have descriptions in the different languages of the realm. MSP (Mud Sound Protocol) is in and many of our areas now have their own .midi files attached to enhance the play experience.  AAW offers many races and classes, with more to come. All characters are dual classed so that you get all spells/skills from your primary class and s/s up to level 30 in your second class, yielding an immense range of possible combinations.  New original areas are constantly in development, and our aim is at having totally original world one day! At the time being we are half way there.</desc>

    <desc>We pride ourselves in bringing a game with integrity, stamina and honesty to our players. Our channels are free of cursing and the environment is friendly. Our players are helpful and enjoy aiding new players. Our immortal staff is talented, experienced and dedicated. Many of the staff have been part of AU for over 5 years.</desc>
    <desc>Adventures Unlimited is not a cookie cutter rom based mud. The development has been focused not on what other muds provide to their players but instead on the path that AU occupies alone. The land of Tharel has been developed continuously throughout the years of the existing of AU. It has gone from a completely stock world with no original areas to 75% original with over 10,000 rooms.</desc>
    <desc>AU continues to develop and evolve. Our website contains logs of all of our changes made from 2001 to the present day.

UEI is a quasi-private social MUCK that started as a sort of moving away from the overwhelming furry populations of most MUCKs.  We wanted more style and intelligence in our conversations and chillspaces and less in the way of yiffing and scritching.  So it's pretty small and personal.  RP is possible and encouraged but there hasn't been a whole lot taking place yet.  Right now it's just a laundromat for slackers to hang out in and talk about.. stuff.  Also illustrators are very welcome.  Yeah.  Cor, what a crummy description for a muck.  If you think this sounds at all interesting, have a see of the abortive web page.  If you're still there, drop a line via email and we'll talk.  Notice:  The address and port of UEI are intentionally unlisted.

    <desc>Our mud is a complex and 'real' fantasy world. We encourage roleplay, though we don't enforce it. The tuneable global channel may be used only for newbie related questions. There are no levels in the mud. You gain experience by improving your skills, solving quests or by exploring new places rather than by killing the same monster repeatedly. It is a unique blend of a hack &amp; slash and a roleplaying mud. You really live in the world, it is not just theatrical roleplay. There are many features that keep you busy exploring, so you won't fall back to boring hack and slash routine. Mud features: 20+ open guilds. Most of these guilds are led by players so admission in a guild is not always automatic. Complex monetary system. 20 playable races with their own language. About 120 spells and 90+ different skills. Unknown characters will be seen by their appearance rather than names. Team system supports back row for spellcasters and archers. Weather. Overland map. Combat includes bleeding, unconsciousness, breaking or severing of limbs. Special races: flying races, water breathing races etc. and a lot more. 60+ unique quests (not autoquests). Numerical values are shown as text or displayed by bars. Players are entitled for detailed character generation after they have already spent some time playing the game. Detailed character generation includes a background story which could be standard or player supplied. Players can own houses with saved equipment. Crafts include forging, carving and tailoring.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Rifts: Chronicles of Kingsdale. A MUSH set in the popular RPG of Rifts. A cyberpunk game set some time after the initial collapse of civilization, magic and technology flourish and compete. North America is dominated by the Evil Coalition States, human supremacists who believe that the only way to guarantee the safety of mankind is the complete destruction of everything non-human or magic.</desc>
    <desc>The MUSH itself is set in the city of Kingsdale â€“ an oasis of personal liberty, science and racial tolerance that is surrounded on three sides by the Coalition. Chronicles promises intricate and carefully woven story and many opportunities for personal development and advancement. In-character politics, investigation, research and experimentation are not just encouraged, but essential and the administration pride themselves on creating an environment where role play is the only essential 'ability'. The careful, quiet scientist is able to take on just as much of a role in our plots as the hulking warrior or the shifty mage. At Chronicles, brains count for as much as brawn.</desc>
    <desc>Feel the tingle along your spine as a the shadow of a vampire slips past in the darkness. Soar a thousand meters over monster-laden forests in your flying power armor, ever alert for threats to the helpless people far below. Experience the power of magic as you open yourself to a ley line. Know fear as you stare into the cold, unblinking mechanical eyes of a full conversion cyborg. Discover that friendship is not diminished by race, creed, or profession. Feel pride as you stand for one of the few bastions of 'good' that in North America. Above all, feel liberated as you let your imagination run free.</desc>

    <desc>Age of the Throne is unique MUD in more ways than one, we have written the game from scratch using our very own programming language and we have also aimed for a theme found nowhere else in the Gaming World. Set in fashionable 17th Century Paris the game evokes and emulates the period of History that saw King Louis XIII on the throne of France, Cardinal Richelieu as Head of the Church and the constant rivalries that ensued between the Kings Musketeers and The Cardinals Guard.  The locations within the game are replicated from original maps of the time.</desc>
    <desc>As our programming language does not restrict us we are free to implement many original and interesting features into the Gameworld.  The Combat, Movement and Skills systems featured are like none other.  Progression in the game is attainable by many routes other than tireless questing for points.</desc>
    <desc>The Age of the Throne website has recently had a professional makeover and now boasts many useful pages and resources to help the newcomer to quickly acclimatise into this unique gaming environment.</desc>
    <desc>Age of the Throne employs a full time programmer allowing us to add new features to the game on a weekly basis as well as promptly responding to queries and bug reports.</desc>

    <desc>Now in its 13th successful year, Age of War has received several major code changes throughout the years, with a lot of these being unique to the realm. AOW currently permits you to select from one of fourteen races, with each race having its own special attribute modifiers. Some races will therefore be better suited for one of the eight professions or classes than others. Your base class will also effect what remort class you get, if you should choose to remort. AOW is also home to several logical, maze and hack-n-slash style zones, 97 percent of which are unique. Those zones that have stock area names have been severely modified.</desc>
    <desc>Some of the unique features of AOW include:</desc>
    <desc>* Full clan support. * A lose nothing, gain nothing arena. * Clan halls w/ restricted access and saved treasuries. * Automatic auctioning system. * A 24 class remort system. * Two huge continents and several small islands. * 103 zones with 9800+ rooms, 3300+ unique mobs, and 5300+ unique objects. * A huge 10-zone skyway which allows travel by air. * Massive flowing river systems that allow travel by boat. * A vast ocean only accessible only by ship. * 4 hometowns on the mainland. * A stagecoach offering travel to 3 of the different hometowns of the mainland. (Great for beginners) * Two hometowns within a huge new continent. * Several in-zone mini-quests. * Low-Level Autoquests. * Mid to Top Level Autoquests. * Unique holiday questing zones each filled with several mini-quests. * A fully automated newbie guide giving complete tours to newcomers. * A Unique newbie zone with special newbie equipment. * A Dueling area for Player Killing.</desc>
    <desc>* New Stuff * * Vandric Harbor Addition!

We have always prided ourselves on being truly unique with our gaming experience and design. We also have the richest history and storyline of any mud that is out there. Our shortened roleplay history is 40 pages long, giving players the ability to truly see the timeline and progression of the game. We have just finished a 1 year long rewrite of the code to create a truly unique gaming experience. Our two imps have a combined 29 years of mud design experience and can trace their mudding roots back to some of the original muds of the late 80s and early 90s. If that is not enough to convince you to check us out, just go through our character creation and you will be hooked by the flexibility and wide array of paths a character can go down. We are currently rebuilding the player base now after 2 years of construction, so get in now and become part of the history and lore. We look forward to seeing you and are sure you will enjoy your time with us. After all, we are a mud built on the ideas of thousands of players over the past 8 years.</desc>

    <desc>posMUD offers a variety of unique experiences that cannot be found anywhere else. * The staff codes and builds on a regular basis, improving the MUD and making it more enjoyable for the players; this is on top of an already mostly original, as well as large, world and class system. The staff and players are also friendly and willing to tend to new players' questions and concerns. * Gone are the days of spending hours leveling; posMUD is based solely on PK and competition. All characters begin on the highest mortal level, are given 3 newbie hours to practice their chosen class's skills and acquire basic equipment, and then are free to duke it out with other players as they see fit. The MUD is highly balanced, with a variety of different classes to choose from, each with distinct skills and spells, creating a unique experience each time you start a new character. * Players can also join cabals, groups of players that work together for a cause, for protection, and are given special cabal- restricted abilities. Cabals are headed by an leader chosen by proving their worth and responsibility, and are given many political privileges such as allegiances and war with other cabals. * The world as it stands is quite large, with over 8000 rooms, over 90 areas, and a plethora of items, equipments, and powerful non- player opponents to vanquish. Certain items are limited to a preselected number to give players something to strive to acquire, whether it is from the item's original holder or another player. * There are also rare rewards for superior players, such as useful quest skills and tattoos, symbols of immortals that grant players a powerful special ability. All of these things blend together to give the posMUD a very unique, entertaining, and addictive feel, to the new and old player alike.</desc>

    <desc>Almaren is a derivation of the ancient (and alas, dead) DikuMUD of Eltanin, which saw it's day in 1991-1992.</desc>
    <desc>Almaren was designed to support human interaction in the form of quests and player killing.  We recognize that killing monsters is, simply put, trivial, and that phase of playing the game is to be taken merely to learn the MUD in preparation for participating in quests and acquiring better (limited!) equipment through PK.</desc>
    <desc>There are 7 distinct classes.  Class lines are not now, and never will be blurred by multiclassing or by sharing too many skills.  Mages are mages, and Warriors are warriors.</desc>
    <desc>Equipment exists in both random, and standard limited form. This allows (and in fact, encourages) healthy PK to exist to circulate item's such as the Goblin King's crystal shard, and Miko's titanium ring.  Randomly created equipment is well distributed throughout the world such that one is not required to compete for the limiteds if desired.</desc>

    <desc>Looking for a huge world to explore? Tired of clumsy pay-for-play games disguised as \"pay-for-perks\"? Bored of enforced role-playing and looking for a place where you can indulge in wanton slaughter or clever banter with good company? You've come to the right place!  Ancient Anguish is a vast, free, and incredibly engaging MUD that has since 1992 retained a friendly and loyal playerbase.  The world is constantly expanding, adding new challenges, fun new highly developed classes, and more ways to pass the time than you can swing a hobbit at. Home to an average of 40 players at a time - any time of the day or night -  you're never hurting for a partner in genocide, a room full of poker buddies or just someone to chat with.</desc>
    <desc>Ancient Anguish received the prestigious MudConnector \"Mud of the Month\" award in November 1995.</desc>
    <desc>One of the things that really sets Ancient Anguish apart is its commitment to both balance and diversity. Each race, class and guild is genuinely unique, every combination providing the player with a different set of strategies and perspective of the world. While the necromancers raise one of their many powerful undead minions to annihilate anything that stands in their way, rangers prefer to raise a wolf from a pup as a lifelong companion that will eventually grow to enormous proportions! There's no end to the amount of strategies you can use to enjoy the game, and you'll play for years trying all of them out.</desc>
    <desc>But our engaging gameplay is only the beginning.  Ancient Anguish is an open ended story, a fantasy novel come to life, a perfect place to escape from reality. An adventurer weary of hack and slash can relax in a posh restaurant, fish for giant squids in the ocean, engage in a game of trivia, plant and nurture unique herbs, woo sultry exotic dancers in hidden desert cities or compete in an elf tossing contest. The possibilities are endless! Ancient Anguish is not just a mindless treadmill to run on, it is a magical world waiting to be explored.</desc>
    <desc>So if you're looking for a place to cure your bloodlust, a wonderful and beautifully described place to explore, or just a friendly game of chess, AA is the place for you. Join us at anguish.org on port 2222!</desc>

    <desc>build a rusty gate to an old warehouse go to the gate create a rusty old car paint it as tomato create a dusty coversheet paint it as lightgrey put it on the car</desc>
    <desc>Naturally you can say, do, shout, think, sing and ponder to communicate with others in the same 'room' as you.</desc>
    <desc>Some technical info: COW is running from my own dedicated server so is very fast (Its running from a 32Mb RAM drive). Its a single perl script with a few supporting CSS and image files. COWScript is a scripting language I have designed specifically for coding objects in cow.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and R. Zelazny, Lost Realms is the perfect blend of both worlds: Middle Earth and Amber.  War. It never ends. When good and evil clash, the heavens cry, the winds howl, and the rivers flow red. The sounds of metal against metal echoing through the night, as one kills, and is killed.  Towns that can be conquered. Strongholds which offer great protection for the newbies and those wounded in battle. Staggering numbers of spells and skills to choose from, to heal, and to harm. All waiting to be discovered in the huge world of, what is basically, an everlasting battle arena.  14 races. 1 aim. The Good, the Evil, and the Misties, who fight to kill them all. Join us, and get lost in our world.</desc>

Seeking to break the stalemate, the Kilrathi have launched a surprise offensive through the edge of Terran-controlled space in Gemini Sector.  A tenacious counteroffensive has blunted the Kilrathi assault, but with a massive Kilrathi force in front and a morass of corruption behind, it may only be a matter of time until the Terran lines break...</desc>

    <desc>We are without a doubt the OLDEST and LONGEST RUNNING Dragonlance Mud around.  Ansalon is a legacy thats been around since the time of The Keep, spanning more than 13 years of the absolute LOVE of Dragonlance.  We are all about the roleplay, the storytelling, and keeping the magic of Krynn alive.</desc>
    <desc>Ansalon has the fortune of having an older average playerbase. Teens are still encouraged and nurtured, but the majority of our players are adults escaping from the real world for a little while each day.  Our staff is comprised of professionals:  scientists, bankers, teachers, artists.</desc>
    <desc>We fully encourage clans and nations.  Ansalon is one of the very few muds that new people can come in, carve out a nation for themselves and rise to leadership positions through simply the force of their roleplay. Many of our existing groups are looking for fresh blood as well. Our clerical system is one of the best found ANYWHERE.</desc>
    <desc>If you have any comments or questions, feel free to email us at ansalon@mudmagic.com  We'd love to hear from you.</desc>
    <desc>(On a personal note, we have recently moved from wolfpaw to mudmagic because of security isuses.  This being said, we can be accessed from multiple ports.  If 8679 is down, try 8678 or the java/telnet connect through the website which will always work!)</desc>

    <desc>Apoc is one of the oldest muds still running, having been created from DikuMUD Gamma 0.0 in October, 1991.  Modifications to the MUD are shaped by the players themselves, via suggestions and ideas they submit to the implementors. Our average player base of 2000 is compiled of various players from sites all over the world, including the United States, Australia, Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</desc>
    <desc>Apocalypse Forever contains 71 fantasy zones for game play, over 40 of which are original works, created by the players themselves, specifically for this MUD. Anybody can create a zone for Apoc, not just immortals.</desc>
    <desc>Apocalypse Forever currently has 11 races (Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-elf, Half-giant, Halfing, Human, Minotaur, Pixie, Triton and Uldra) and 12 classes (Anti-Paladin, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Magic-User, Paladin, Ranger, Samurai and Thief). There are more than 200 spells and skills available for use by the various classes.</desc>
    <desc>Apoc is very proud of its amount of help, so check that out when you log in.  Other commands of interest to new players are Index, Rules, Zones, Info, and News.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to the city of Last Haven. Nestled in a valley somewhere in the devastated wilderness that is the planet of Athran. It has been nearly a thousand years since Loki's Hammer fell from the sky destroying the world that was. As the darkness fell about the world, the elves re-emerged and fell on the struggling survivors of the asteroid's impact. The last fractions of Humanity banded together, building a city in which to defend themselves against the bands of savage hunters. Now the city struggles to survive, the only fertile land that they have made themselves. Surrounded by a blasted and hostile waste, with enemies that kill and enslave without compassion, Last Haven is also humanity's last hope. Find your challenge. Guide your character through the political intrigues and hostile environment to succeed in the way that you choose. With over a hundred usable skills you can craft your character to be anything from a bard to soldier, from a politician to a farmer. Life can take some unexpected turns. Find out what your destiny is today. Enter the world left by Loki's Hammer.</desc>

    <desc>If you are new to MUDs, Arctic is a text-based adventure game where you create a persona and adventure in a fantasy world. Arctic is set in the world of Krynn, the basis for the Dragonlance novels. You can explore the world of Krynn -- combating dragons, ogres, draconians, and countless other creatures, discovering rare treasures, and finding hidden locations -- along with hundreds of other players.</desc>
    <desc>Arctic is geared towards a mature game-playing audience. Character interactions are handled in a realistic manner. Player-characters stealing from and killing each other is not necessarily encouraged, but it is allowed.</desc>
    <desc>As the premier Dragonlance MUD, Arctic has developed a rich environment that provides countless hours of free enjoyment. Start playing today and find out if you have what it takes to join the adventure!</desc>

    <desc>The universe of Areth is a dimensional eddy, a Sliders-esque parallel Earth into which dimensional anomalies deposit beings from other worlds, times, or even realities.  If you've never seen Great Dragons, Predators, Kzinti, and Klingons slaying wizards protected by legions of acid-blooded Aliens, play Areth and you will.</desc>
    <desc>Game-wise, Areth's a fair and challenging game environment.  Immortals are strictly forbidden to aid *any* mortal in gameplay, give out free equipment, or level their friends.  Everything on Areth, except for the boost to level 2, is earned by the player's own innate skill on a level playing field. This annoys twinks who schmooze their way to the top on other muds, but we're not interested in them anyway.  On the other hand, players looking for a fair, challenging game environment are well rewarded here.  We have 12 classes planned, 9 are currently available: Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Psion, Rogue, Samurai, Ninja, Martial Artist, and Warrior. There are presently over 300 functional skills/spells, and by the time the rest of the class work is done there will most likely be around 450.</desc>
    <desc>We're also looking for a few talented builders.  Talented means being able to build using a text editor, not MZF or OLC.</desc>

    <desc>Realms of Discordia There is a place we go to - that we see and live in - when we close our eyes. This dream world is filled with things our everyday life is not; strange creatures and foreign places that are exotic and yet all too comforting. Itâ€™s a fantasy, an existence bigger then our own world and hauntingly familiar for all its strangeness. Sprawling and complex, it exists in its own set of laws, rules, and boundaries - ones that we yearn to escape to when our own minds and hearts are heavy. Its people are odd, sometimes frightening; but this world of make believe has been fashioned with love and care and needs only your mind to fulfill its existence. Titillating, validating, fulfilling and realistic - it is the ultimate dream world. This, my friends, is the Realms of Discordia - laden with action, adventure, magic, and magical beings. It is the place we long for in our dreams and fantasies, the world we seek when we close our eyes and the home our hearts long for in its quiet moments. A fantasy realm, an original ROM derivative, Realms of Discordia features over one hundred custom built areas, over seven thousand hand built rooms. There are over two dozen playable races, each with its own original history and purpose. The magic and skill systems are exquisitely crafted, each ability leading to another and each skill itself necessary to a characterâ€™s talents. Built with pride, crafted with love, and coded with precision - this is a game, a community, a world all its own. We are role-play encouraged - for the illusion of this fantasy needs your creative talents to feed it. We offer in game and in character rewards for good storytelling, good role-playing, and even individualized quests for those who seek a deeper level of in character gaming. We also strongly encourage hunting - finding, fighting for, and claiming levels and new skills and abilities with the rewards one can earn. Overall, our positive and helpful staff and players encourage a sense of community and friendship that we hope will be the most important thing you walk away with from your experience with Realms of Discordia</desc>

    <desc>Millenia ago, the discovery of hyperspace travel brought the galaxy together, giving birth to a democratic union of star systems known as the Galactic Republic. From the time of its inception, the Republic grew, over thousands of years, to encompass vast numbers of inhabitated worlds. The survival of the Republic depended on two factors: the wise governing of selfless administrators and lawmakers... and the preservation of harmony and justice by a heroic warrior fraternity - the Jedi Knights. In those glorious ancient days, a great many Force sensitive individuals willingly entered arduous training under accomplished Jedi Masters, taking up the weapons, the knowledge, and the powers of the Jedi Way.</desc>
    <desc>=====================================================================</desc>
    <desc>We are currently in the process of revamping the game, and therefore not open for regular play. The code has matured over five years of development, and now our focus lies on sorting out bugs, finishing old projects, and adding some new features as well.</desc>

    <desc>Austria is uneasily located at the heart of Europe, flanked by Italy and Germany on the one side and by Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia on the other. It is a natural bridge between prosperous Brussels and impoverished Tirana, between a towering Germany and a cowering Serbia, between the Balkan and central Europe. In its former incarnation as the Habsburg and capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Vienna ruled all these regions.</desc>
    <desc>Today still Vienna itself is still like a medieval bastion. Anachronisms abound, from antique decorations in otherwise ultra-modern buildings to forgotten catacombs beneath bank vaults and subway tunnels. Honest-to-goodness castles and imperial palaces still exist and stand side by side with ancient cathedrals, modern shopping malls and sky scrapping office buildings. The city is more than only a natural hub between East and West Europe. It is also a pivot of Europe's organized crime and espionage. Albanian drug dealers clash with Ukrainian and Moldavian human traffickers and Russian KGB agents turned weapons smugglers, and there they face off with already established west European and Italian crime cartels.</desc>

    <desc>In October of 2001, the Visitor Motherships arrived over the cities of Earth, 50 in all. They claimed to have arrived intending peace, but they lied. They came to take us prisioner and to rob the planet of the resources. By the end of Novemeber, they controlled the planet. Lucky for the Earth, a Resistance was able to form, and beat them with the Red Dust.</desc>
    <desc>After a full year, they came back, as the Dust wasn't completely effective, and now, can not be released again for enviornmental and Health reasons. The warmer regions are back under Visitor Control, all except LA, thanks to a deal brokered between the Visitors and Science Frontiers, who has taken over the LA Government. That was 6 months ago. Now the Resistance is in hiding, for the most part, looking for a way to cause the Visitors troubles.</desc>
    <desc>V: The Visitors Return is a MUSH that allows you to take on the role of a Great Resistance Fighter, or an Evil Reptillian Visitor. Feature Characters from the NBC Mini-Series and Television Series are available for you to play.</desc>
    <desc>V: The Visitors Return is an online roleplaying game based partially on the original mini-series V which aired in the mid 1980's. The premise was simple. AHumanoid appearing aliens came to Earth, pretending to be our friends. They said that they wanted friendship and access to some of our more readily available resources (ie: water) and in return they would give us technology and their gratitude.</desc>
    <desc>In actuality these peaceful Visitors were actually after something more sinister. Humans. As Food. Disguised under human looking masks and fake flesh, the aliens were really members of a warlike and very hungry reptilian species.</desc>
    <desc>Unlike the Mini-Series and Television Series, the exact dates have been updated and pushed ahead roughly 15 years so the invasion place in the 2000's instead of the 1980's. Besides that shift, we try to remain as faithful as possible to the ideal of V and it's events and characters despite any \"cosmetic\" differences the shift in time creates.</desc>

Shadows, both physical and spiritual descend across Europe during those long centuries between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance. This is the setting of Wayward Souls, a shadow play projected against the backdrop of the bloody 11th century - a time when superstitions are closer to reality than one would care to admit.</desc>

    <desc>Asylum MUD is one of the most popular quest-orientated hybrids on the Net. Asylum has developed into one of the most advanced MUDs of its type - with an emphasis on playability and fun, and now more than 75 quests! Several custom subsystems provide the basis for Asylum's success including: advanced body combat against a range of AI mobiles; auto-regeneration across the virtual world; a unique mobile combat classification system in which combat depends on a wide range of mobile attributes and the SOAS object-based spell attribute system. Asylum also proudly boasts the invention of the DEFROB system - a unique concept in which individuals can gain more powerful immortal levels, by defrobbing to a mortal role and completing more quests.  UPDATE March 2002     Some of our recent enhancements include the following: LODGING: You no longer have to run around looking for equipment. Lodging allows the storage of your items, safe and ready for the next time you login. BANDS: Asylum's very own Guilds - incorporating Freelancer, Barbarian, Monk, Outlaw and Blademaster -with many more to come including Conjurer and Healer DEFROB and AUTORESET: The original and still the best - we defined them LUCRE: Our own currency and rewards system. CHARACTERISTICS: Advanced character attributes means you can develop your character in your own way with Power, Agility, Intelligence, Fortitude, Alignment, Sanity, Favour and Reputation.</desc>

    <desc>Ista and High Reaches are gone.  It's looking to be a bad Pass.</desc>
    <desc>The Starcrafters were predicting this turns ago, insisting that all the signs pointed to the upcoming Pass being particularly strenuous, and perhaps overlong.  They never predicted that the dormant volcano in which Ista Weyr's population made their home would abruptly return to life, nor that High Reaches would suffer a devastating earthquake - and there have been smaller but no less terrifying events the world over.</desc>
    <desc>In the wake of the too-close-together disasters, geologically-minded Craftfolk sought out an old, abandoned Weyr, one that had been created in a water-worn cavern system but finally deemed too cold and isolated for maintenance.  But... it's geologically stable.</desc>
    <desc>And so Starmount Weyr was born, a creation of politics and councils and desperation.  Finally under the management of its Weyrleaders, it nevertheless owes much to High Reaches Hold, Kalseru trading post, and many other Pern locales for help and support in both building-- and, in a great many cases, refuge, as a significant proportion of its population comes from the destroyed Weyrs.</desc>
    <desc>Set well up in the Northern Barrier Range, it looks to be a cold, hard road to independence, but its people have thrown themselves into the game with willing hearts.  For the most part, anyway-- except for the ones who seem to be hoping to make a mark, and not always for the good of the people.  The Weyrleader is rumored to be among them... at least when his back is turned.</desc>
    <desc>Come help us create something fascinating - what FrostFire becomes from this point is up to the players.  With open Impressions (golds under some restriction... so what else is new), Crafters, player-dragons, and an extremely laid-back atmosphere, we're out for whatever fun we can make for ourselves.  It's a Pern that's ripe for change and looking potential disaster in the eye.  What could go wrong?</desc>

    <desc>Thorns of War is a browser based game which mixes elements of a MUD and a Sim. While there are plenty of monsters to hone your fighting skills against, the main focus of the game is on living out a life in the open world provided. Building is nearly unrestricted and includes everything from roads and bridges to towers and halls of timber or stone. While many players throw their support behind an existing village, some choose to strike out on their own, blazing new trails and settling new areas of the MASSIVE world.</desc>
    <desc>Nearly all items are crafted by players of varying professions, from bronze casters to locksmiths, and working together is key to survival in a world that is, quite frankly, a pretty rough place. Fortunately there's always an NPC hireling looking for work who you can hire to guard your lands, pan for minerals, forage, chop timber, dig up stone, or even give you a hand down in a kobold hole.</desc>
    <desc>Unlike most MUDs you'll find this one to be very mouse friendly, with a mini-map and an organized layout which makes it very easy to play and keep track of what's going on around you.</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars MUSH: New Worlds is a new Star Wars MUSH based on the classic West End Games Star Wars Roleplaying Game, utilizing the D6 system. The game's storyline itself is an offshoot of the original Star Wars MUSH (SW1) and went online December 26th, 2008. With about 50 players online at peak hours (PST, generally), it is an active new Star Wars world beginning in 18 ABY - the Empire is the reigning galactic government, but faces opposition from a new Sith Empire and the remaining forces of the New Republic.</desc>
    <desc>The game's staff setup is unique in that is promotes democracy first and foremost; faction staff positions for the main factions are elected by their players, as is the game's Direc tor. To put a stop to staff abuse, there is also an elected Player's Council which serves as a check against potential administration abuse; the game strives to put the players at the front and put an end to staff abuse of power.</desc>
    <desc>The game features approximately 170 coded (and canon) Star Wars ship types (based on D6 stats), over 300 weapons and items, over 40 coded worlds to explore, and five main factions to join - the ruthless Empire, the new Sith Empire of Darth Malign, the strong-willed New Republic, and the unaffiliated independents. In addition, there are a multitude of small organizations to join - such as the criminal Black Sun, the vile Hutt cartels of Zorbo and Gulgoth the Hutts, and so on. The game also features the player-run Bank of the Core - players can deposit their earned credits at the bank by opening an account, and earn interest monthly. They can also take out loans to finance that starship of their dreams, or to open their own business.

Create your character from a pool of 21 distinct playable races (each with its own unique city) and 28 classes (including mortal, remortal, realm lord and legend tiers) to find your own path through life. Not enough? You can also choose from 8 object crafting profession classes, adding greater flexibility and depth to your character. With every race having its own attributes and skills and each class having specialized abilities with lasting usefulness, play-style is greatly individualized. StormHunters is fully playable and we continue to regularly add new content. Will you be a veteran warrior, overwhelming hordes of foes with brute strength or perhaps a cunning assassin, utilizing style and strategy to destroy your targets from the shadows? If such brutality is distasteful, etch away your opponents' very life force with the arcane arts. In a world with such violence, there is also the need for skilled healers. If versatility is your motto, simply combine elements of each. Every build has its strengths and weaknesses, so you need never worry about creating a \"useless\" character. Our friendly immortal staff and helpful players are always willing to answer any questions you might have. If you're the quiet type, you can use the built in help systems--including shelp (information on skills and spells) and ahelp (area information) functions--to find your way through the world. With an almost entirely custom world of over 100 areas and an exhaustive list of changes, there is certainly no shortage of things to do. Not the type to sit idly by and watch the world evolve around you? Join our staff as a builder and help us create new content--bring your areas to life and break away from the cookie cutter mold!

    <desc>Jordan's Wheel of Time books. The original game and codebase, As The</desc>
    <desc>Wheel Weaves, has been open since 1998. The most current incarnation</desc>
    <desc>of it  - The Shadows Embrace - has been recently (and most likely</desc>
    <desc>temporarily) shutdown due to hosting issues.</desc>
    <desc>The mud is currently undergoing a large revamp in terms of both code</desc>
    <desc>and areas, but is fully functional and playable. We generally have</desc>

    <desc>As you may have heard, the DragonBall Saga codebase leaked a while back. We got ahold of the code and started up our own MUD. Before you judge, please note that Warren, the original owner of the Saga codebase, has given permission for us to use the code.</desc>
    <desc>DragonBall and DragonBall Z are highly popular anime series', based off the manga created by Akira Toriyama. DragonBall GT was not created by Toriyama, but is still just as popular as the original shows and mangas.</desc>
    <desc>DragonBall Infinity offers several of the things seen in the popular series. Races such as Saiyans, Nameks, Bio-Androids, Androids, even Ghettis; and more races are still in the works. Skills and abilities such as Super Saiyan, the Kamehameha wave, Kaioken Attack, and much more features bring the series straight to your computer.</desc>
    <desc>We feature an exclusive RolePlay storyline, derived from the series themselves. RolePlay is highly encouraged, with new plot twists forming every day.</desc>

    <desc>Affectionately known as KoD by its loving players, Knights of Darkness is the second oldest and longest-running Star Wars-themed SWR still in existence.  Over the past year or so, we've lost a lot of steam, for various reasons, but now, we have an almost entirely new staff (with a few old faces still hanging around, as well) and we're on the move to take the Star Wars MUD scene back by storm. We've just moved to a brand new dedicated server with a 10mbps connection, and the coders are now hard at work implementing some long-needed changes that are sure to make the experience more enjoyable and exciting than anything any other SWR can even dream of offering.</desc>
    <desc>Set about 27 years after the Battle of Yavin, Knights of Darkness currently resides in an alternate Star Wars universe whose history has been developed based on years of player interaction and the weaving of hundreds of plot lines.  In its current incarnation, the Star Wars Galaxy is once again under the reigns of the Empire, as a crumbling Republic struggles to exist at all in the face of such an all-encompassing power.  Tensions are high - and that only makes the RP that much better!</desc>
    <desc>And it's about to get even more exciting - change is just around the corner, and along with it will come the most detailed character customization any SWR has ever seen.  Without getting into too much detail, let's just say you DON'T want to miss it!</desc>
    <desc>Come over and play KoD - if you don't want to download a client, you can even use the Flash MUD client on our website, which, in and of itself, is full of wonderful things, and even more to come.  Join up now, and be a part of the action, the fun, and the wonder that is yet to come!</desc>

    <desc>Despite its age, the MUD is constantly evolving which makes it both challenging and entertaining to new and old players alike.

    <desc>BatMUD features a detailed combat system, player to player commerce, playerbuilt cities, seafaring vessels, mounts and hundreds of custom zones. The unique atmosphere of BatMUD has given birth to many clones, including two sibling sites: BatMUD classic (BatMUD as it was in 1994) and HardCore BatMUD (fast powerplay with permanent deaths). However, the original remains among the largest and most feature-rich MUDs on the Internet.</desc>

    <desc>On ShinyMud, you will find a host of features that are either completely new, or much improved over stock Mythran.  The multiclass system allows you to gain levels in up to four out of eight classes, with experience requirements (and gains) increasing often (optimized for addictiveness!).</desc>
    <desc>We also feature: multiclass skills; an expanded clan system which allows clans to declare war or conquer areas to help with purchasing clan equipment; a unique and optional religion system which provides mild subtle bonuses as you level; a Final Fantasy-like system of elemental strengths and weaknesses; magic resistance; magic power, which increase or decrease the effectiveness of your spells; and dozens of genuinely new skills based on custom-built game mechanics.</desc>
    <desc>At the moment, Shiny is about 75% comprised of stock areas, though they've been altered in subtle ways, and there are always more areas on the way.  To this end we are hiring builders (building is via OLC) to expand the mud universe.  Creativity is essential.</desc>
    <desc>ShinyMud is the third incarnation of a mud run by administrators with a decade of mud-building experience.  As such, the game is quite stable, and many long-running Envy and Mythran bugs/issues have been fixed (e.g., no KILLER flags, ever!).</desc>

    <desc>Perhaps you have seen this world before. Perhaps it is all too familiar. Yet, to fully understand it, you must look at it in a different light: a soft flame kindled for millennia and held up against the growing darkness that surrounds it. The century to come will almost extinguish that fire. In the decades that follow, technology revolutionizes the world, aristocracy becomes an anachronism, gentlemanly behavior becomes obsolete, and world wars ravage the planet. The idealists of that brave new world become even more jaded and degenerate, forgetting the propriety and etiquette of the Victorian era. Forget these shadows of a future past. History has yet to be written, and the protagonists of our Passion Plays may rewrite them in their own image.</desc>
    <desc>Welcome to another realm, one shrouded by fog and lit by flame. City of Serenity is like that of our own world, but is one in which monsters prowl the night. They could just as well survive in the shadows of our own world -- or at least in the shadows of our past. Later generations of vampires herald this time as the height of their unseen civilization. Yet, the mists of time are like mists over Venice; It distorts all we think we perceive.</desc>

Visit an empire that spans half a globe ruled by an immortal, and discover a country ruled by a government its own citizens don't know exist. Fight the Illuminati, or ally with them, and travel a world nearly the size of earth where magic and combat are common skills if you want to walk out of town and come back alive. This is a world where ANYONE can learn magic, and everybody alive who travels can fight well. Bandits and brigands rule the roads, and most of the world is fractured and politically divided.</desc>

    <desc>\"The year is 2390. The Federation as you once knew it, no longer exists. The combined might of the Tri-Powers could not withstand the Dominion onslaught. On the very streets they once defended, the Federation's political and military leaders were slaughtered. Yet, even in these dark times, the spirit of the Federation could not be crushed. Out of the devastation arose The Pacific Alliance and the Coalition for Unity, each seeking to rebuild the former Federation under it's own philosphies. Spouting about the need for a stronger military emphasis, Alliance party members verbally challenged the more traditional Coalition. In a time when the former Federation worlds are seperated, each party seeks to bring them into it's fold. Starfleet, ever steadfast in it's directives, finds itself split in it's support for these vying fledgling politic powers, each of whom believe themself to be the legitimate UFP.\"</desc>
    <desc>Star Trek: Interregnum seeks to embody a universe not too disimiliar from the Birth of the Federation. The goal of the game is create an environment where player actions both matter, and serves to drive the MUSH forward. Even though, it is Federation vs Federation, all races remain playable. Featuring both a custom version of ASpace, and it's own unique Econ system, STI's codebase serves primarily to drive roleplay forward and arbitrate possible conflicts.

    <desc>Somewhere between real and imaginary lies the world of Avatar, a second home where many adventurers have made life-long friends and established reputations for themselves by achieving Heroic, Lordly, and even Legendary levels of power.  When first entering the world of Avatar, new players can select a race from our wide selection of 24 base races and a class from our 7 starting classes. However, these are only the beginning of our character offerings. With time and experience, players can unlock a number of prestige and remort classes, as well as remort races.  Avatar is a massive world divided into different tiers of players. New players begin as Mortals and by leveling and gaining experience they become Heroes. Both tiers of players exist on Midgaardia, a realm that has over 200 different areas to explore. Lords are former Heroes who achieved a sufficient level of power. They are charged with the responsibility of protecting Midgaardia from the evil of the outer planes. Lords make their home on Thorngate (a small town that exists in the universe) and travel to Avatar's 11 different planes of existence, fighting those who would seek to invade. Occasionally, a Lord will reach such a high level of power that he/she will be able to ascend to the Legend tier. Little is known about the Legends, but it is rumoured that they are champions of the Gods, fighting for a cause that they are not even aware of.  Even with Avatar's high level of re-playability and the many different ways one can experience the game, what keeps new players (and existing ones) coming back is the people. Our diverse player base is filled with friendly and helpful individuals who make it a great place to play.  Additionally, the dedicated Immortals, Angels, and Track Staff are available to help improve Avatar and making sure it remains a safe and family-friendly place to play. Come and find out for yourself - we look forward to welcoming you to the AVATAR family!</desc>

    <desc>The Burning Eye is back!  Formerly the Rebirth of Arda, we have returned.</desc>
    <desc>We have tried to make our mud as new and balanced as possible without losing the best parts of a Rom code base.  The Burning Eye has many improvements and additions to make a good challenge for even the most experienced mudder.</desc>
    <desc>While any previous experience is an asset, newbies are welcome. We have tried to cover everything with our comprehensive help files so feel free to come enjoy an interpretation Tolkien's Middle Earth.</desc>
    <desc>The Burning Eye features a selection of intelligent mobs who will act 'intelligently' when fighting, casting or hunting and avoiding the players.  They will also use equipment that is lying around, even if its your weapon and they disarmed you. Also they all have classes and are equal to the players in almost every way.</desc>
    <desc>We feature 100 mortal levels, 12 Races, 14 Classes, 6 Clans and over 350 Skills and Spells.  No Level Restrictions on Eq - rather your options are determined by Size, Race, Align &amp; Class.</desc>

    <desc>Cajun Nights, New Orleans by Night, has been running for over 10 glorious years now with a good playerbase and a great team of staffers. All our supernatural spheres are active, as is the crime/civil/law sphere and we are running regular cross sphere plots to involve mortals and super alike.</desc>
    <desc>Rhost is our game server and it gives us several terrific features. Obfuscation and the Umbra are now coded, as are the Auspex and Mind Shield effects that go along with it. Our new queue system gives the staff more information about what player requests are still pending and what needs to take place to get them resolved in a timely fashion.</desc>
    <desc>Our mortal and mortal+ sphere has many openings for those who prefer playing characters without supernatural abilities. Whether you want to be the high-society type or be involved in the University or one of the street people, there are plenty of opportunities.</desc>
    <desc>If the world of crime--being one of the bad guys or being one of the people trying to catch them -- is your thing, there are plenty of openings. There are openings for everyone from mooks and drug-pushers to white-collar criminals. Things are as open on the other side of the street as well -- patrol cops, state police, FBI agents, to name a few.</desc>
    <desc>The shifter sphere is a terrific place to serve Gaia. There are openings for every tribe except Red Talons, and for every auspice. Kinfolk are needed as well, and we are also accepting bete/fera. The Umbra will be very important in the stories to be told in the coming months, so those of you with an interest in Terra Incognita may find it an especially good place to play.</desc>
    <desc>Kindred: There are openings for all Camarilla clans, including the Gangrel (who, in our chronicle, have never left the Camarilla) and for Setites as well.</desc>
    <desc>New Orleans hosts a vibrant Voodoun community, which anyone, mortal or super, is welcome to join. Not everyone is chosen for a special relationship with the lwa, but each spirit is seeking followers right now. We operate our own version of Voodoun, developed for us by Sam Chupp and recently updated by our own staff.</desc>
    <desc>Last but certainly not least, Cajun Nights offers a large Mage sphere. New characters are welcome, but we are a bit pickier about which traditions are available. Acolytes and consors are being accepted almost across the board.</desc>

    <desc>We are one of the muds which people try to imitate, rather than an imitator.  We feature an array of races and classes which have enough variety to make each character a unique experience, not just the same thing with a few different skills.  Warriors specialize in weapons and can learn the secrets of the 36 Legacies of the Macalla. Shapeshifters can learn from ~100 different forms.   Necromancers can risk their existence to transform into the undead.  Thieves can customize their skill list as they train among various masters. Paladins can earn additional communes befitting the virtues they best espouse.  The list goes on!</desc>
    <desc>A large world: 250+ areas (~23000 rooms), all written especially for CF, including many puzzle/quest based 'exploration areas'.  Extensive help files (1600+) both in the game, during character creation, and on our web page if you want to read them safely.  Player Killing among characters you'd be competitive with.  A deep roleplaying environment with a flexible reward system.  Hundreds of built-in quests, plus custom ones run live by our staff. A system of religions where Immortals tattoo their followers and empower priests.  Eight highly detailed Cabals to join for protection, power, and camaraderie.  Nine different ways to earn experience.  Tight game balance which offers a challenge even to experienced players.  We have been open to the public for over eleven years!</desc>
    <desc>Carrion Fields is COMPLETELY free to play.  No pay-for-perks arms races, no hidden subscriptions, no trial periods.   While our extensive commerce system makes copper coins coveted within the game, real-life money won't do you a cent of good.  Don't be fooled by games that say \"free\" but don't mean it!</desc>

The old mine, long dormant, is being reopened by a large corporation when miners start going missing. A series of what appear to be coyote attacks have people locking their doors earlier these days. And now there's rumors of vampires in the night, like out of the movies. Who will investigate the mysteries of Blue Earth? Who will stop the nights of terror? And who will dare to hunt what's hunting the residents of the town?</desc>
    <desc>We are a small but original game with a modern fantasy theme that takes it's inspiration from television shows like Supernatural, Buffy, Dresden Files and True Blood. We encourage use of genuine mythos from any culture on good old planet Earth. Not every vampire is the classic Western World's idea of a vampire and sometimes what looks like trailer trash is a hero just waiting to prove themselves.</desc>

    <desc>This was then: There was world ruled by a generous king who was kind to all of his people. But amidst the dark corridors of the king's castle evil lurked. The king's magician had vicious plans to take over and rule with darkness at his side.. he opened a portal to the underworld.  An army of dark minions swirled out thrue the portal and into the peaceful kingdom. But the dark forces were treacherous and betrayed the magician.</desc>
    <desc>The kingdom was swiftly overthrown, many people were killed and tortured. People fled and sought shelter, they gathered in small tribes and soon found that the only place where they could be safe from these evil forces was underground. They started building underground complexes, magically hiding the entrances from the dreaded army above..</desc>
    <desc>Evil ruled the surface for many, many years. Man lost count of how long they had been underground and the surface was soon but a legend of old times.</desc>
    <desc>This is now: As time went by and evil ravaged the surface, the climate started to change.The surface started to become a dark and desolate place, haunted by cold winds. Evil slowly retreated and eventually light came back to the kingdom. But the climate never changed back and the kingdom will never be the same again. With the return of light man began to open their well-covered hatches from below and take a glimpse of the outside world. Seeing little danger, young and brave adventurers soon started to explore the surroundings.</desc>
    <desc>You are one of those adventurers and it is your task to give Bards of the future something to sing heroic songs about around campfires once again.</desc>
    <desc>Soon you will be able to join an entirely new guild!</desc>

    <desc>This is a MUD that use the MUD system of play and the TEXT ADVENTURE puzzle system, in a world where the fight is not the heart of the game. We have not many rooms, around 800, because are very hard to explore, and nobody ever did it. We made this MUD writing the code by zero, and it worked from 1990 to 1994 on videotel.</desc>
    <desc>Now we are back on internet and we are testing the MUD for the telnet system (before we used the minitel). The world is a allegoric, medioeval and satiric. A client in JAVA is coming.</desc>

    <desc>You have found the one and only Lost Wishes Mud. Since 1995, we have been keeping people like you off the streets.  Lost wishes has everything you have been looking for in a mud, but have never been able to find in one place. An original code base supports a truly amazing mudding experience. New players can begin their experience in Mud School, where 12 grades of step by step tutorial make you a mudding pro in no time. Once out, explore the four huge domains, encompassing over 20,000 original rooms. Esdragen is a massive land of light and dark, past and future. Mainland is home to the bustling City of Windaria, set against a backdrop of deserts, mountains, and plains. Emerald is the sparkling jewel of a continent as its name implies, but along with the wondrous beauty there is much that is evil. Although Nautica is itself an island, it also is composed of countless islands throughout the world. To explore the lands separated by seas, you can charter a ferry, rent, or even own, one of the variety of boats.  Before setting out too far, join one of more than a dozen of our original guilds, each with something different to offer. Whether you wish to be a powerful mage, a rock hard gargoyle or a top notch warrior, we have guilds suited to these (and many, many more) styles! Add to that fully customizable player creation that lets you choose from one of nearly twenty different races. There is no maximum level which means you can play until your heart's content. Tons of colorful weapons, equipment, and other useful items await your discovery. And there are plenty of quests throughout the four domains that can bring you fame and fortune for more than just killing.  What really makes Lost Wishes special is the people that inhabit it. Although role playing is acceptable here, it is neither required nor enforced, so if you want to assume your character's persona or just want to be yourself, you will be welcome. The atmosphere is very open and friendly, so you can make friends, join a clan, or even party with people to kill things. And while there is almost always a trivia game or chat going on, you can turn off comm lines if you wish. Even though the mud doesn't endorse PK, there are simulated PK areas like the arena, or the Dark Realm, if that strikes your fancy.</desc>

    <desc>It is said that a very rare, special kind of butterfly one day accidentally crossed over from the realm of Aarils and came to the real world â€“ this world.  A kind of chemical found in the powder on its wings caused it to create a temporary gateway between its world and this - a procss still today considered by some as magical, and by the more synical - simply too advanced for current science.  It came through that portal and sat down on a manâ€™s arm.  The man tried to slap the butterfly and managed to crush the butterflyâ€™s wingsâ€¦ and some of the powder on its wings came on the manâ€™s hand.</desc>
    <desc>That night the man had a dream about another world, another realm of reality too distant from this and completely alien.  Upon waking up he wasnâ€™t at all sure whether he had dreamt it all, or if it really existed.</desc>
    <desc>By the next day, the powder had been completely absorbed into his body and created a gateway in his mind.  And the next night, he dreamt again.  And the next, and the next, until he finally came to the realization that it was more than just a dream.  He was living - in this reality, this alien realm.  And he learned that he had the power to control his visits to this world.</desc>
    <desc>He was the first of the visitors who came to Aarils.  Nobody knows how the gateway between this world and that of Aarils remained open â€“ even after this man had died.  Some say it was not in his mind at all, but a physical gateway â€“ a portal â€“ that opened between this world and Aarils, allowing anyone who seeks it out to find it, and enter.</desc>
    <desc>Today, the gateway exists, and people from this world enters Aarils in search of a new life, new riches and new happiness.  And some find their heart's longing, while others find only despair and heartache. The portal is clear; the gateway open.  The opportunity is yours. Will you be a hero or a foe, a wealthy traveller or a bandit, a farmer or a thief, a tailor... a shopkeeper...  The world is endless and the choices unlimited.

Struggling to your feet you take inventory:  wounded body, a chaingun with one last clip of ammo, one fragmentation grenade, and the iron will to look past those odds.  Corpses of Blackhand's entire regiment litter the ground around you.  Only a few survivors remain, and calling them survivors is a stretch.</desc>
    <desc>Wild bolts of lightning blast across the sky, announcing the death of Yet another of the reborn. In the tracks left by the lightning,graceful, metal wings can be seen, beating against the gray clouds. She is coming for you, the reborn.  Slapping your last clip into your chaingun, you watch as the  avenging angel drops out of the sky and lands before you, folding her wings around her body like a cloak. A Black metal hand draws a white blade from the glinting scabbard at her hip. As the avenging angel raises the blade to strike, you compress the trigger and begin firing.</desc>
    <desc>A hail of bullets wash over the winged woman, most just bouncing off her black skin like sand in the wind. Grimly, you pull the pin on the grenade and hold your last hope in your hand. You may be dead a minute from now, but you are determined not to go alone... This is your last stand, this is war, this is, CYBERASSAULT...</desc>

    <desc>There are 15 races to choose from, some found only on select realms. Examples of some races are: Avariel, Brakian, Halfling, Koa, Ssirith. Our races are diverse in their characteristics, slight drawbacks, and advantages.</desc>

I added customized color, races, classes, remort system, usable furniture, players houses, auto quests, sound and a host of other modifications! I tried to make a mud that was easy to follow. A mud where newbies could learn and experienced players could be challenged. Along the way I had plenty of help building unique areas and coding special spells and skills. Of course, as with any mud, the most fun is when the player base is large. We allow grouping and in some cases (hard areas) it is encouraged! Drop by and give us a try! I think you'll like it.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Dark Risings  Imagine yourself a werecreature, skulking through the deep forest after the moon has caused you to involuntarily transform into a beast of unimaginable terror.  Or...a hunter that specializes in running the creatures of the night into the ground, and has the power to do it.  Or...a Gypsy, persecuted by outsiders, loved beyond all measure by the family you cherish in return, skilled in dance and storytelling, haunted by the leeches and undead which fill the night.  Or...a scholar of the arcane, with the power to change the very fabric and nature of the world through unique magics which only you have mastered.  Or...a merchant, wealthy beyond the dreams of most, fearlessly leading your clan against the most dire monsters in all the realms for one reason: profit.  Or...imagine yourself minding your own business when before your eyes a man shifts into mist, or a woman's caress turns into the bite of a vampire.  Imagine becoming ensared in dark and secret intrigue.  Imagine earning the trust of a patriarch, and becoming one yourself.  All of these roles and more are yours for the exploring at Dark Risings.  Any new character has a 7% chance of being a werecreature mutation of your chosen race.  Vampires are hand-picked by patriarchs based on the strength of roleplay.  Dark Risings has made sure to preserve that familiar feel of a ROM MUD.  Creating a new character is easy; simply choose the default of the class you want to play and you will have all the essential skills and spells picked for you to optimize your playing experience.  As you become familiar with the game, you can re-create your character to choose a wider variety of skills and spells, or create new characters for an entirely different playing experience. With 14 races, 14 classes, and 7 guilds, the possibilities are virtually endless.  Our mantra is \"equal but different\", and you will find each different race and class to be unique but carefully balanced.  We have a large variety of new and unique areas and features, as well as areas which retain the basics of stock ROM but which have been heavily polished and revised to enhance game play. For example, we have dozens of original built-in miniquests which offer rewards in the form of gold, items, equipment, and bonus XP if you choose to explore while you level.  This is a constantly evolving process; we work every day to create new miniquests and to enhance the feel of the game.  Role playing is heavily encouraged, with a name &amp; description approval process (online, no emailing required) and valid in-role reasons for PK (player killing) attacks required.  We have lots of quests and the kind of game balance only achieved from years of live play and adult admins with several decades of combined experience. Player Killing (PK, PvP, Player Conflict) is a part of this, although with care it can be entirely avoided without hugging saferooms all day if you so choose.  We have a NB channel where you can ask ANY question about the game and get an immediate answer (usually from several sources).  We also have an extensive helpfile system designed to give hints and tips to all of our players, not just the ones who have been with us for years.  Annoying things that Dark Risings is missing?  There's no rent, no hunger, no thirst, and resting heals you as fast as sleeping.  We pride ourselves on being a player-centered mud.  What this means to us is that we ask for and incorporate player input on all major decisions about the game.  We have an \"idea\" board from which we have implemented many, many good ideas submitted by our players. We also strive to embed player-run RP into the game itself, by building items, rooms, and even entire areas to reflect the contributions of players.  We feel that Dark Risings is a tapestry of RP, and every player's thread is important to the whole of the game.  We have an excellent base of mature and highly skilled role players who make Dark Risings an excellent and exceptionally fun game to play.  Come see what makes Dark Risings in the top ranked MUDs on the Mud Connector!  Join our family, make friends, fall in love!  It happens every day.  Right now, we have 35 people playing and having fun as I write this.  You could be the 36th.  When you log on, be sure to read \"Help New\" which is an index of help files designed to make getting used to Dark Risings easy.</desc>

DR was the first mud to offer quest-based advancement, and still maintains a large number of challenging and interesting quests.  Although a number of guilds have cropped up, DR is still based on the traditional LP mudlib. Ergo, it lends a classic feel to what we believe is a classic game. There are about 600 active players, but rarely more than 25 or so on at a time.  DR has almost never been down for more than a weekend, and recently moved to a much faster machine, so it probably *isn't* the slowest LP in existance anymore :)</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars - Galaxy At War is a new MUSH set at the dawn of the Knights of the Old Republic era</desc>
    <desc>It is roughly 3,960 years before the battle of Yavin as seen in Star Wars: A New Hope. The galaxy is still reeling from the recently ended war with the Mandalorians as well as the loss of more than a third of the Galactic Republic navy to the rogue jedi known as Malak and Revan who have fled into the unknown regions. The jedi strive to support the Republic while trying to rebuild their reputation and their ranks. The Mandalorians, following the death of Mandalore the Ultimate, have scattered throughout the galaxy with no purpose or direction. Pirates, Smugglers, Hutts, and worse all begin to take advantage of the weakness within the Republic for their own personal gains. Attacking convoys and settlements all along the fringe and even within Navy patrol zones. Meanwhile the Sith grow in numbers as young jedi are lured to the draw of power as opposed to the dogmatic views of the jedi...</desc>
    <desc>With one war ended there is hope for peace in these dark times, but the control of the Republic and the Jedi is fragile. Even without a war looming over their heads the citizens of the galaxy are overwhelmed by lawlessness and strife while whispers grow of a new threat on the horizon, promising the transform everything they know once again into a Galaxy at War.</desc>

    <desc>The Great Hunt is an intense player vs. player environment, which has countless modifications of spells, skills, and melee to enhance the combat experience. It is not uncommon to see hour long battles of epic proportion. The game play and balance are finely tuned to create a pure adrenaline rush unlike any other game.</desc>
    <desc>Despite the competitive environment, entry into the mud is friendly. A leveling system involving quests and interaction with your guild master will teach you everything you need to know about the game. In general the players are friendly and helpful. The Player vs. Player experience is not intense until level 50, so its relatively safe to learn the game in peace until you are ready to fight.</desc>
    <desc>There are also many unique areas, including 'artifact areas' such as the Tower of the Necromancer, or the Ogre Cavern, which provide unique puzzles and extensive mob artificial intelligence. There are also lots of custom additions such as potion brewing.</desc>
    <desc>The admin and developer team is dedicated, the server is stable, and the mud has been around since 1994. Roleplay is not required, but is certainly welcome.</desc>

The Protectors of Life managed to defeat the Lords of Chaos, and lock them out of the Realm.  But now, several centuries later, the magic of the seals has been weakened.  One of the Evil Lords has managed to cross the boundaries between the Planes, and seeks to revive the Arcanix.  Only a single Protector stands against him.  He desperately seeks aid for his beleaguered world, and has sent out his call across the multiverse. Even though the call was meant for aid, the Evil Lord has managed to slip some of his evil minions through the gate, and so the battle rages on.</desc>

    <desc>It's not known when or how the Island known as Hideaway came into exsistance. It was simply there, exsisting in a state outside of time itself. Every so often, in different places in the world, the boundaries of the Island would encroach into one of the many worlds in the multiverse and a portal would open. Sometimes for days, sometimes for only moments. Of course, it was inevitable that eventually people would fall into those portals and end up upon the Island.</desc>
    <desc>At first, only a few appeared, many baffled as they discovered only females seemed to be able to exsist on the Island. The men who found themselves upon the island were changed by the place's magic. Those first arrivals found the fishing around the island to be plentiful and prosperous, and so a small fishing village, the village of Hideaway, was born there in the sheltered cove. Over the years, however, more and more people began to appear, the appearance of portals in the real world beginning to grow more frequent. The population began to grow, forming and shaping into an open, friendly environment for all kinds of women, with all kinds of different interests. Now, a few hundred years after the first few people found themselves transported to Hideaway, the little village has grown into a bustling town, full of lively activity and fun.</desc>

Sane people were asleep in their houses, or drinking in a busy tavern, forgetting the terrors happening beyond the safety of the city walls. Tonight the mood was much more somber than the typical nightly ruckus which normally filled the bars.  The full moon alone meant that the dead would be out in full force, but the recent bloody assaults by the hill giants in the forests to the north would contribute many fresh members to the army of the dead. There was some hope tonight.  A band of Mystic Knights had recently arrived in town, fresh in from their battles on the wild southern continent. They would do their best protect the few people who hadn't made it to the city, and fragment the army enough to prevent a full assault. But everyone knew a few wouldn't get a chance to see the sun rise.</desc>

    <desc>For those of you who have not yet been in Deeper Trouble, let me tell you that it is very old. It goes back to 1990 and was created by a handful computerscience students.</desc>
    <desc>Artesia - as the world is named - is, and always will be, strictly fantasy-based, and although it has its roots in the stories of J.R.R. Tolkien, many other species that share its theme and spirit also populate it these days.</desc>
    <desc>It is constantly being improved and new additions and changes come often. This is no DIKU style MUD. It is complex by nature and thus very challenging and exciting.</desc>
    <desc>One can here enjoy wandering about in a large world, either alone or in a party with other players. Since the different areas and puzzles are very distinct, although not by theme or connection, there is always a new challenge waiting for any adventurer regardless of skill and experience. Players also tend to stride to become the best.</desc>
    <desc>There is also a social aspect to the game. Many new friends have been made, and also real-life gatherings are being arranged now and then so that the true people of Artesia may exchange gossip, face to face and over a mug of dark ale. :-)</desc>

Runners can choose between several races and join or leave a certain guild at their desire. Delusion is very fast-evolving and the friendly team of administrators is constantly working on new additions and challenges for your gaming enjoyment.

    <desc>TriadCity is a large-scale multiuser role-playing game with a literary orientation, currently in beta.</desc>
    <desc>While role-playing MUDs are fairly common, this one is different.  Where most MUDs focus on 'kill the monster' style adventuring, TriadCity explores themes which have been central to Western culture: good and evil, city and country, nature and civilization, personal and collective identities, violence and nonviolence, freedom and slavery.</desc>
    <desc>'Literary orientation' means that narrative techniques from the novel and other traditions are incorporated, such as voice, point of view, characterization, plot, and so on. Various forms of subjectivity are imposed on the characters which players create, some relative, some radical. This means that character histories and views of the world are potentially unique to each individual player.</desc>
    <desc>We opened to the public on 10/1/01 and are just starting to build our player base.  We hope you'll check us out, and will tell us what you think!</desc>

To reach 5th legendary level, you have to come through special challenge, which will test your knowledge of your character. Thus only the best players can ever reach 5th legendary level. Of course you can try until you learn enough to succeed. Successfully completing the challenge opens whole new range of possibilities to advance your character far beyond limits of lower legends.

    <name>Tank Mage Deathmatch</name>
    <codebase>[Unknown] Modified Tank Mage Deathmatch</codebase>
    <www>http://www.tankmagedeathmatch.com</www>
    <desc>Tank Mage Deathmatch is based on Ben White's Tank Mage Deathmatch, the winning entry from April 2000's 16k Mud Server Competition. The mud demonstrates the next stage in the evolution of MUDs -- A fully integrated browser client. Right now the technology is only supported by Google Chrome, but in about a year every major browser will support the technology.</desc>
    <desc>NOTICE</desc>
    <desc>You must use Google Chrome to play Tank Mage Deathmatch.</desc>
    <desc>PLAYING</desc>
    <desc>Each player will start in the designated start room. You can move between rooms using, n, s, e, w, u, d commands, depending on exits. You will also start with a number of health points (HP).</desc>
    <desc>The aim of the game is to defeat other players in magical and melee combat by spending attack points (AP) to cause each other damage. Damage is represented as a loss of HP. If your HP drops to zero or below, you can consider yourself killed, and you will restart in a randomly selected room.</desc>
    <desc>Powerups also appear from time to time in selected rooms, and have various beneficial effects.</desc>
    <desc>COMBAT</desc>
    <desc>Combat is based on attacks and spells. Attacks are performed by spending AP; the attacks either damage the opponent or are blocked. Spells can be cast by invoking the required runes at a cost of AP; spells either protect, do damage, or are negated if the target has invoked the negation runes.</desc>
    <desc>Maintaining invoked runes also costs AP; if the player does not have enough AP to maintain invoked runes, then the runes are automatically invoked.</desc>
    <desc>Every three seconds, you receive another (HP + 7) / 8 AP to spend, up to a maximum equal to your HP. No matter what the cost of something, if you have at least 1 AP, you can perform it; this ensures that players close to death can still do something useful.</desc>
    <desc>Moving from one room to another costs 2 AP, and all invoked runes are revoked. Changing targets also causes all runes to be revoked.</desc>
    <desc>TARGETING</desc>
    <desc>You will target all your actions at a specific player. This player must be in the same room as you for you to target them. All rune invocations are recorded relative to this player. Invoked runes are lost when changing targets or moving from room to room.</desc>
    <desc>If you use the target command with no parameters, then you will target the first player in the room (other than yourself). If you want to target a specific player in the room, you can enter either their name or number as a parameter. To determine their number, use either the look or who command.</desc>
    <desc>ATTACKS</desc>
    <desc>Attack costs, damage, and negations: Lunge 1 AP, damage 1 HP, negated by Chop or Block Hack 1 AP, damage 1 HP, negated by Lunge or Block Slash 1 AP, damage 1 HP, negated by Hack or Block Chop 1 AP, damage 1 HP, negated by Slash or Block Block 3 AP, damage 0 HP</desc>
    <desc>Your attack will be blocked by your target if one of the negation attacks was performed within the last 9 seconds, and it was among the last three attacks.</desc>
    <desc>COMBO ATTACKS</desc>
    <desc>If you perform certain attacks in the right order, you will receive a bonus attack, or combo attack. Combo attacks can only be blocked by the target if they have performed all the listed attacks within the last 9 seconds, and they were among the last three attacks performed. Once you perform a combo, the attacks you used for it can no longer be used as defences from other attacks.</desc>
    <desc>Shield Rush: Damage: 3 HP Requires: Block, Block Blocked by: Block</desc>
    <desc>Forward Combo: Damage: 3 HP Requires: Lunge, Slash Blocked by: Block and Hack</desc>
    <desc>Reverse Combo: Damage: 3 HP Requires: Hack, Chop Blocked by: Block and Slash</desc>
    <desc>Body Strike: Damage: 3 HP Requires: Hack, Slash Blocked by: Block and Chop</desc>
    <desc>Overhead Chop: Damage: 5 HP Requires: Chop, Lunge Blocked by: Block and Lunge</desc>
    <desc>RUNES</desc>
    <desc>Spell rune invocation costs (and maintenance costs): Maintenance costs are charged every three seconds. Invoked runes are automatically revoked when changing targets, moving from room to room, used in a spell, or automatically used to defend against a spell. Rune of Air 1 AP (1 AP) Rune of Fire 2 AP (1 AP) Rune of Water 1 AP (1 AP) Rune of Earth 1 AP (2 AP)</desc>
    <desc>SPELLS</desc>
    <desc>Spells can be cast after the required runes have been invoked. Area effect spells do normal damage to the target, and half damage to all others in the room (excluding the caster).</desc>
    <desc>Magic Missile: Cost: 1 AP Damage: 2 HP Requires: Rune of Air Negated by: Rune of Earth</desc>
    <desc>Fireball: Area Cost: 2 AP Damage: 6 HP Requires: Rune of Air, Run of Fire Negated by: Rune of Water</desc>
    <desc>Stone Skin: Defensive Cost: 1 AP Protection: 8 HP Requires: Rune of Water, Rune of Earth</desc>
    <desc>Ice Shards: Cost: 2 AP Damage: 5 HP Requires: Rune of Water, Rune of Air Negated by: Rune of Earth, Rune of Fire</desc>
    <desc>Poison Cloud: Area Cost: 2 AP Damage: 6 HP Requires: Rune of Water, Rune of Fire Negated by: Rune of Air</desc>
    <desc>POWERUPS</desc>
    <desc>Powerups appear from time to time in selected rooms. If there are players in the room, then the first player in the room will receive the powerup. Otherwise, the first player to enter the room will receive the powerup. Rune powerups are the only way to get runes.</desc>
    <desc>The following powerups are available:</desc>
    <desc>Rune: Earth, Air, Fire, or Water (randomly selected) Health Bonus: increase your HP Sword Bonus: increase your sword damage, to a maximum of +3 Rune Bonus: increase the damage of spells, up to +2 per rune</desc>
    <desc>DEATH</desc>
    <desc>After being killed, all your runes will automatically be revoked. You may have a random number of runes deducted, and sword and rune power bonuses will also be randomly lost. On return from death, you will receive a random number of HP, and will restart in a randomly selected room.</desc>

    <desc>TIPS</desc>
    <desc>When you see a player, use t to target them. Sword attacks can be performed using ah, as, ac, and al. You'll want to use ab to block attacks. Remember that a single ab will block attacks for 9 seconds, if you only use two other sword attacks. Doing a shield rush (ab,ab) will remove your blocks and leave you vunerable to attack. If you want to do a combo attack, perform a block first to leave you at least partially protected from attack. To block a combo attack, you'll have to anticipate what your oppenent is going to perform, and perform the negation move. This is virtually impossible if your opponent has a lot of AP. The Overhead Chop is the most powerful combo (chop-lunge). So if your opponent starts a chop, try to do a lunge to block it. Then return with a Forward Combo (slash, since you already have the lunge). This also means that if you do an Overhead Chop, immediately follow up with a hack to defend against a Forward Combo. Then you can finish with a chop or slash for another combo.</desc>
    <desc>You will want to get hold of powerups, especially health bonuses. These are the only way you can recover lost HP.</desc>
    <desc>Tank Mage Deathmatch is based on Ben White's Tank Mage Deathmatch, the winning entry from April 2000's 16k Mud Server Competition. The mud demonstrates the next stage in the evolution of MUDs -- A fully integrated browser client. Right now the technology is only supported by Google Chrome, but in about a year every major browser will support the technology.</desc>
    <desc>If your oppenent starts invoking runes, try to figure out what spell they're casting. Hopefully you'll either have the runes invoked already to be able to counteract the spell, or be able to quickly invoke them. Otherwise, try running or getting stuck into them with your sword.</desc>
    <desc>Lastly, try not to move from room to room too quickly, because it wastes AP.</desc>

    <desc>We have all of AVATAR's experimental and grandfathered classes as well as all of the NPC races (making the total 40!) for this.  You could end up reincarnated as a Golem Sorcerer or a Goblin Monk.  With 9 classes and 40 races, there is plenty of variation.</desc>

There are several areas open for exploration but the majority of the rp at this time is focused in the capital city.  The magic system is currently being coded.  Unlike most muds, your skills are not limited by your trade and you can learn anything you wish.. provided you can find someone to teach you.  Players are allowed to create or buy their own equipment with base damage. Specialty eq must be approved by an admin and justified.

    <desc>The year is 2438, exactly four hundred years after the discovery of ancient technology on the planet Mars on the second manned shuttle to the red planet. Mankind, in our arrogance, took the technology and turned it into the fuel of our weapons of destruction against each- other. Theories that World War IV would be fought with sticks and stones were greatly over-enthusiastic. WW III lasted nearly twelve years and lost nearly 200 million souls from across the globe.</desc>
    <desc>By the year 2099, the first fully functional spaceport was created on our moon. Luna Base, as it was once called, served as an inter- national space port for all of the Earth. It was also the cause of the first interstellar war, and World War Four. This war was fought almost entirely in space, though many ground troops died, mostly the fight was against technology's power in space. Trillions of  dollars were lost durring the war and none of the sides ended up the winner. The end of that war was literaly the lack of firepower in the year 2138. The final seasefire was declared on May 3rd, 2140 at the White House when all of the main leaders of each of the countries, along with all of their cabinet seats signed a document that allowed for nearly full use of the Spaceport by all countries.</desc>
    <desc>A Subclause of the treaty is that all countries would meet at the Capitol  Building in Washington D.C. every two years. Since the signing of that treaty, not a single member has ever missed a meeting.</desc>

    <desc>There are no big plans, just bug fixes, minor improvements, and giving people who liked the original Assault: High Tech War a place to hang out.</desc>

    <desc>Everwar Rebirth is based on the popular EmlenMUD codebase and is forked from the original Everwar which has been up and running for over 7 years.  The core theme is centered around a struggle between the forces of light and dark as they battle it out throughout a massive custom world.  There are a total of 18 races (9 per side) and 13 extremely balanced professions to choose from ranging from the devestating warrior, to the ellusive assassin.</desc>
    <desc>Work together with your alignment to track and crush the opposing force and loot them of their possessions.  We also have a ranking system where payers can accumulate war points and increase in power as they slay other players.</desc>
    <desc>From a PVE perspective we offer:</desc>
    <desc>* A world brought to life with advanced trigger system * Comprehensive quest and crusade system * Hundreds of custom armors, weapons and gems. * Robust forging system for the creation of items. * Unique dungeon instances (random every time) * Dynamic drop system (diablo style loot) * Overhead mapping feature, no need for custom maps.</desc>
    <desc>We will be launching on the 1st of October, if you're looking for an adult oriented PK mud then give us a try.</desc>

    <desc>After nearly 4 years of development, several false starts, and a lot of blood, sweat and tears, ugradMUD (named after the server it originated on) is finally opening for it's first real round of beta testing.</desc>
    <desc>We are based on CircleMUD 3.1, and have taken full advantage of the helpful tbaMUD community by using their guidance and adminstrative code.</desc>
    <desc>Theme: Medieval Fantasy Genre: Hack and Slash, RP Optional</desc>
    <desc>We have two factions, light and dark. In our beta stages, we are only opening the light races, to ensure that newcomers have a 'polished' experience. We have 4 races in total, and 14 classes. There are 100 mortal levels. Again, only half of both will be available during our early beta stages.</desc>
    <desc>Each race has its own unique hometown and newbie zone. This is no small claim; and it has been the main reason that has delayed beta opening for so long.</desc>
    <desc>Hope to see you around.</desc>
    <desc>Thanks goes to this whole CircleMUD community, without which this game would have died out a long time ago.</desc>

Magic has returned to the world allowing those with the will to use it, extraordinary powers and abilities.  The lines between man and machine have blurred as science finds new ways to incorporate cybernetic wonders into flesh.  Data pirates in the new world called Deckers, interface with the virtual reality of the matrix to plunder one of the worlds remaining commodities; information.  Unexplained Genetic Expression as it is called changed the race lines from color to species as Trolls, Elves, and other creatures of legend emerged from all walks of life.  Corporations who are powers unto themselves put on a warm and fuzzy face to the public while striking each other in silent shadow wars using freelance agents known as Shadowrunners.  This is Shadowrun, and the setting for the MUD known as Deckeon. For nearly a decade Deckeon has strived to recreate the Third edition Shadowrun game in a role playing enforced MUD.</desc>

Most of mankind has perished in an apocalyptic war 150 years ago, and the furries (recoms) escaped the slaughter by fleeing to colonies on the moon, on Mars, and in the asteroid belt. The discovery of hyperspace jumpgates and polywell fusion reactors has led to massive space exploration, and furs now live on various worlds and space stations. Alien species have been discovered. Factions have formed, ranging from free trader associations to bounty hunter and pirate alliances, military organizations, and mysterious intelligence agencies.</desc>
    <desc>-- Some technical info: Some of our worlds allow for free, large scale roaming, making use of the well-known Terraform system. Worlds are original, with their cores hand-built by dedicated realm managers, many of them large enough to be considered a small MUCK of their own.</desc>

    <desc>Chaos Mages are masters of destructive and combat magic, Saboteurs can build bombs capable of destroying entire rooms, Necromancers swell their armies of followers with the bodies of their enemies, Hunters shoot their prey from many rooms away with deady accuracy, and the remaining eight classes have similarly clearly defined areas of expertise.</desc>
    <desc>Above level 11 players may multiclass freely, at a cost in 'credits' much greater than the single credit required to level in the primary class.</desc>

If you wish to have a friendly, always active place to build simply log in and leave a note on the Darkhaven board (the room you drop in after creation).

    <desc>At level 100 a player can choose a second class and gain skills from that class. At 200 they can pick a triple class and gain even more skills and spells. There are also study skills which are high level and special only to the primary class. Once a player gets to 400 they have the option to remort and be born with strengths their character did not originally have. Each time a player remorts they choose a remort skill and gain more base character bonuses. There is also an alternative leveling method called tier leveling. This can only happen with a player is at level 400. They can gain tier levels to purchase special perks such as player restores, immblessings and double exp for a time.</desc>
    <desc>When a player isnt leveling they can be part of a clan, do quests, mine for gems and join sieges. We have global quests which award quest points which can be spent on character enhancements. Dwarves can mine for gems which can be embedded into weapons and armor for eq bonuses. Player and immortal run arena battles happen often so people can battle pkill. Same with sieges. Dragons come down and invade the town of Midgaard and players join the siege to fend off the dragons and win a blessing for the entire mud as well as quest points.</desc>
    <desc>Dragon Swords has been around for a long time and been through a lot. It has changed hands many times and had many contributors. Even so we've managed to survive and keep moving forward in an age of 3D massively multiplayer games. We still have players and staff who are on everyday. Some of who have played for over 10 years. There are players from all over the world and of all ages. There are more men than women as in most gaming communities. Women, we need you! But even with the limited female pop we've had quite a few marriages and relationships come out of Dragon Swords over the years. Its got history.</desc>

We have done what we can to foster a good role playing environment by including skill and dice rollers for players to use, as well as other role playing tools and commands.  If you are not a role player all we ask is that you do not disrupt the role playing of others.</desc>
    <desc>As far as game features on our dragonlance mud goes, we have plenty.  At the current state of the game, we have 7 of the basic classes done, with plans to complete two more before exiting beta, and we also have 4 prestige classes, 3 of which are knight of solamnia classes.  Once the core rules are finished to a 'T', the large amount of our development time will go towards implementing new prestige classes, including all that are in the d20 SRD.</desc>
    <desc>We use a spell memorization system with spellbooks for mages, and we have an ascii map system borrowed from tbaMUD.  Our dragonlance mud also has a fighting formation system, with positions for polearm users and ranged combat.  We have all of the basic dragonlance races as well as several advanced races for good role players.  We have plans to implement a crafting system as well.</desc>
    <desc>So come on by and check us out at Age of Legends: Tales of the Lance d20 Edition.  There's nothing like it anywhere else on the Internet, and we know 1 hour with us will have you feeling the same.</desc>

    <desc>DragonMud is the oldest TinyMud style MU* in existence, (predating Islandia by a few months) and has been continuously online since Thanksgiving of 1989. At the heart of DragonMud is an early 1800's walled city known as TinyLondon.  Perpetually pre-industrial and heavily sprinkled with magic, TinyLondon is a city of cobblestones, carriages, gaslamps, stone bridges and ancient towers. The colorful populace is made up of pirates, infiltrators, thieves, vampires, wizards, questors, merchants, poets, gypsies, ambassadors from other realms, Grand Dames and new immigrants.  DragonMud is not a hack-n-slash, rape-kill-n-plunder environment. A certain level of manners and civility is expected of all citizens. The creation and maintenance of DragonMud is focused on a commitment to user's privacy and autonomy. Patience, tolerance, fairness, understanding, wit, charm, style, curiosity and creativity are values most prized by the citizens of DragonMud.</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars: Shattered Alliance is quite possibly the most heavily roleplay oriented Star Wars MUD of it's kind. Straying from the typical classed system of RiP, SWR, and FotE, we have developed a classless system, in which you can purchase your abilities, feats, and special equipment through the means of Character Points, which are explained in-depth within the game. There are multiple skills, weapons and items -as well as a personalised stat code- to make your character as unique as possible. The way things are worked out here, the chances of seeing two characters with the same skills will be almost impossible...</desc>
    <desc>If you're tired of MUDs that promote themselves with new and exciting prospects and fail to actually produce anything, then Shattered Alliance is for you. Drop by if you think you can handle our warped senses of humour... -Omega.</desc>

    <desc>650 years into the future, mankind has established colonies on various planets.  \"Core\" takes place on one of those colonies: the furthest colony from Earth thus established, on a planet in the Hermes 571-G system.</desc>
    <desc>Tired of playing \"stock\" MUDs?  Core's gaming world is entirely original, and much of the code has been written from scratch.</desc>
    <desc>Core has a player-run economy.  Buy a Personal Mining Dome (PMD), build it wherevere you want on the wilderness map, and setup your own shop.  Adjacent PMDs can be linked together to form Clusters, which grants a transporation vehicle back to The Company's central complex.</desc>
    <desc>Advance to level 3 and you'll automatically be issued free housing.</desc>
    <desc>The \"newbie experience\" was completely revamped in 2007.  As soon as you step off the immigration shuttle, you'll receive an optional NPC-guided tutorial quest that'll get you equipped and teach you some of the basics.</desc>
    <desc>When your mining shift isn't on duty, put on an Environment Suit and explore Core's unique wilderness map.  Hang out in the player-run pubs, try your luck at gambling or the Stock Market, or challenge someone to a game of CoreQuad.</desc>
    <desc>The weapon system was rewritten in 2008.  In fact, the game continues to be updated and improved.  The central \"changelog\" is posted on our public web forum for all to see: http://www.coremud.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=959</desc>

    <desc>* From classic horror themes to cartoons, Quake, anime and the X Files, our original areas are fun for both the exploring and kamikaze mob killer alike, some even having 300+ rooms. * Bloodbath Tower, one of the coolest Quest Areas in existence in use for the top-tiered players, which offers awesome merge quests, its own unique token system and a continuous fun challenge even for the seasoned veterans. * Various fun quests, including trivia, extreme hot potato, scavenger hunts, scrabble, socket games, dice, paintball hot potato and even mob creation/building contests. * And of course, the players and staff's personal favorite, Dreams has a MASSIVE top-tier Smurfs zone, offering hundreds of unique and hilarious mobs and objects, and a final Pokemon inspired Smurf card quest bound to keep any player up late collecting.</desc>
    <desc>Finally, what fantasy would be complete without a tiered remort system that gives access to lots of spells and skills and many unique clans full of wonderful like-minded individuals with their own guilds and clan member rooms to enjoy. So come and visit, the smurfs will be thankful for your blood.</desc>

    <desc>The 7th Plane is a highly customized game, featuring a completely original world and mythos. The primary foci of the game are PvE and character building, but there are also options for PvP and RP. The general goal is to allow for PvE, RP and PvP to integrate together seamlessly. Some of the gameâ€™s more prominent features are listed below:</desc>
    <desc>- Unique classes, with each having drastically different styles of progression and game play</desc>
    <desc>- Medium sized, original world with spatially realistic layout, making it highly walkable</desc>
    <desc>- NPCs that have complex and interesting behavioral routines, and few game mechanics to differentiate them from PCs</desc>
    <desc>- Deeply involved crafting system: create weapons, armors, items and structures from up to 90 different resources</desc>
    <desc>- Physics based game mechanics, such as: falling from heights, sinking in water, dragging heavy objects and characters, solar/lunar cycles with tides and seasonal changes producing dynamic weather that has tangible effects on the game world and characters in it</desc>
    <desc>- Skinning/butchering systems that allow for the full dissection of any creature, NPC or PC, dead or aliveâ€¦</desc>
    <desc>Furthermore, The 7th Plane has almost 100% up-time and has been around for 7 years now. It is still in active development, and we welcome new ideas and suggestions for improvements from our players. You are cordially invited to join our community and become a part of the ever-growing world.</desc>

    <desc>The mud is still very much in its development stages and suffered from a few heavy setbacks, but we aren't willing to give up.

Unlike most other muds, you don't gain any experience for killing things, but there are still plenty of foes to fight. When the gods notice your progress, you are challenged with a quest to solve on your way to eternal fame and immortality.</desc>
    <desc>DUMII has a high quality standard with both its world and its features. Some of the features are:</desc>
    <desc>* Classless &amp; raceless system (be any class/race you want). * Four different alignments, with different quests to solve. * Player-run guilds. * No rent for your saved equipment. * Very friendly parser.

No detailed character creation. * An extensive list of original actions/socials is available to all players, with free-text emote commands available to responsible role-players as well. * Built-in macros/aliases, automapping and word wrapping. You can set your page width and page height, and the server will adapt to it. * There are no fixed colours anywhere; all colours can be changed to your own preferences. * Many games are available like Fourday's Bindings or Kalah. * You can buy your unique, personal home and it can be located almost anywhere in the world.</desc>

    <desc>Dune III MUSH is set roughly 100 years prior to the opening of Dune, with House Corrino being firmly in control of the Imperium. Houses Atreides and Harkonnen are not nearly so pivotal to the plot as they are in the novel, though they do have a presence in the game. The Fremen, an unknown entity at this point in the timeline, have no real contact with the Known Universe. The Bene Gesserit Sisterhood remains quietly but firmly intertwined in the affairs of the Imperium, the true depth of their subtle influences sensed by none beyond their order. Kaitain, the Imperial Seat, is the center of role-play, although RP on the hereditary and contractual fiefs of the Houses Major is supported and encouraged.</desc>
    <desc>Politics and intrigue are the hands which weave intricate storylines and plots amongst the players. To ensure the focus remains on the RP, DuneIII does not employ the use of a combat system, and economy is only minimally coded to support the CHOAM contract system. You will find no hack and slash gaming on DuneIII; the outcome of physical clashes will be determined based on consent between the players involved. The tenet of IC (In Character) Actions leading to IC Consequences (ICA=ICC) is a concept of importance to all.</desc>

The earth is scarred with urban sprawl, the only places where metallic buildings and deep artificial caves are not constructed are upon the treacherous outskirts of the continents, now ruled by revolutionary tribes and self-liberated cyborgs. Even a central intelligence has arisen from what was known before as the internet. People of all financial and social backgrounds use this virtual reality like a drug, plugging into it for entertainment, cybercrime profit, or long distance buisness. But outside the cities and wastelands, bitter conflicts arise between the Union and those who resist it.So from droid hunters, Union marines, hackers, anarchists, biopunks, and spaceship designers, find your place amongst the fog of the world of ArsonMUD.</desc>
    <desc>ArsonMUD is a very new and fresh MUD, trying to build a larger playerbase for intense roleplay. We work upon the concepts of cyberpunk, biopunk, and other dystopian styles to create an original and innovative new experience.</desc>

Although the Israelites still have many enemies, David's kingdom now stretches from Kadesh and Tadmor in the north to Sinai in the south. He rules from his new cedar palace in Jerusalem which was built using workers and materials sent by Hiram, king of Tyre.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to the mystical fantasy world that is The Edge of Darkness. Within this ancient alternate reality lies a vast medieval realm know as Doraak, filled with adventure, danger and wonders beyond imagination. Almost every type of terrain conceivable can be found within Doraak's ever expanding boundaries..from the icy arctic wastelands to the mine-filled Tahrenian mountain ranges of the dwarves. There are the sprawling grasslands of the west and the great barren deserts of the far south. There are numerous islands in the northern and southern oceans and there are the measureless swamps of the east. There are all these regions, plus hundreds more just waiting to be explored. And throughout all of these lands lie countless ancient forests, some of which are bright and pleasant, yet others are damp, dark and perilous. In this realm, any path can lead to discovery, adventure...or death!  These wild, rugged lands are only recently beginning to yield to the influences of civilized society, as the many humanoid races of Doraak struggle to establish small pockets of civilization amongst the far-reaching and untamed wilderness. There are a number of cities and villages that can provide safe haven to a weary adventurer. However, even these seemingly peaceful towns can offer far more than just a good night's rest, to the inquisitive or careless explorer.  In spite of humankind's best efforts, there are still dark forces at work within Doraak, which seek to undermine all that has been accomplished. Both the minions of evil and the misguided good lurk everywhere throughout the realms, and beyond, building strength and patiently waiting for their time to come again...  So come and test your might, your skill and your cunning against all that The Edge of Darkness has in store...for the world of Doraak awaits its next savior...or victim!</desc>

    <desc>Founded in 1991, Elendor is the premiere J.R.R. Tolkien based world with 2000+ users and 5500+ rooms. Set between the times of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, Elendor is devoted to providing a quality roleplaying environment where activity is primarily social and interactive rather than automated. On Elendor, players may take on a character from any of 5 different races and 22 different cultures of Middle-earth, each of which has a dedicated staff of players ready to help you learn the game and how to play. The staff on Elendor is especially helpful and friendly to players who are new to Tolkien and/or to MUSHing in general.</desc>
    <desc>The roleplaying environment on Elendor consists of a beautiful and accurate representation of Tolkien's land of Middle-earth where room descriptions change dynamically with the time of day, seasons, and weather. Elendor has an extensive global command system that includes a finely-tuned skill/stat-based combat system, a full economic system with several forms of currency, an elaborate language system with support for 19 different spoken and written Tolkien languages, and a convenient wardrobe system with which you can create a detailed col- lection of descriptions for your character. Elendor also provides a custom designed chat system with over 100 channels and its own mailer system equipped with over 100 bulletin boards where players plan game activities and discuss Tolkien's writing.</desc>

    <desc>Elephant Mud is one of the older, larger and more advanced muds out on the net today, with a wealth of experience behind it. Offering a wealth of features not found on its competitors, it brings totally unique guilds, noble Houses, sophisticated multi-classing, bloodlines, stamina, player run newspapers, exploration rewards, and much much more to an arena awash with 'stock' alternatives.</desc>
    <desc>Elephant Mud allows PK, but it is socially controlled. The town Council can bounty, fine, jail and execute people for breaking the law. Laws are both set and enforced by players and Council have sophisticated investigative tools as their disposal. A clever criminal still has a chance of course, and the fight between law and chaos goes on eternally.</desc>
    <desc>The mud is set in a medieval/dark ages world, where magic, not science, is the key area of research. Humans, Dwarves, Elves and many other races rub shoulders and work with (and against) each other to defend, or bring down the town of Drakenwood and its environs. It is a dangerous world, but a world equally of great rewards, and truely has something for everyone.</desc>
    <desc>Elephant Mud has 3000-4000 regular players, many of which have been playing for in excess of 5 years with a notable number who have been here for 7, 8, 9 or even 10 years. With longevity like that we invite you to come and find out for yourself what all the fuss is about. Who knows, you may even decide to stay!</desc>

    <desc>This works great for multi-classing. The leveling system extends to 50 and upon there, you gain the ability to fuse with another player and restart at level 5. This fusion mixes both genes and race creating a more powerful next generation being something that was never been before. This makes for endless replaying and customising.</desc>
    <desc>During fusion any of the other players limbs and/or genes can be transferred to you and vice versa, but be careful, genes can also be lost. Stats and attributes will also increase or decrease accordingly. No two players will ever be the same. With the exception of standard weapon attacks, combat and spell casting time is not randomised, you employ full control of when you cast the next spell or strike the next hit through our unique action point system.</desc>

    <desc>If you've never seen our mud, allow me to provide a brief description. We are based on an entirely original world, that has over 20k rooms in numerous areas, and even an overland area for you to explore.  We have several cities, and a multitude of creatures and items in our world.</desc>
    <desc>We have some original classes and concepts, including squires, who can become Paladins and Anti-Paladins, and rogues which become Assassins.

We try hard to be as newbie friendly as possible, we have a helpful staff and our playerbase is quickly returning. In addition, we offer a system of faith-based Orders, that have places for players to assume leadership positions.</desc>
    <desc>If you're looking for a good place to RP with fun, friendly players, please check us out.  Also on the horizon is an OOC voice chat system that players will have access to, and a web page is in the works.  We had over 5 years of development before, and now we're back, and looking to move into the future.  Give us a shot, and I think you'll be pleased.</desc>

And for those that have attained level 80, an entire new system of hunting to counter the typical experience gain will be found. Making \"Everyday Hero\" a great deal more fun!</desc>

    <desc>Act of War is a fully functional PvP mud. It is cut into three kingdoms. Tier the defenders of the faith. Kael the embodiment of justice and war. UnderMountain hell on urth.</desc>
    <desc>Kingdoms fight a three sided battle to win for their own views. While RP is not widely used, it is accepted and tolerated. Newbies may be thought of as spies when they first create. Newbies who stay and level will see things will change. Most players are willing to help out newbies. Some players will be testing the newbies before helping.</desc>
    <desc>AoW has a small immstaff who attempt to help as much as possible. While always working from the shadows. Imm's have very, VERY, little interaction with the PBase. This is done as not to interfere with the flow of the mud.</desc>
    <desc>This is the \"original\" Act of War. There are others that host. This version was passed to Sagan by the creators. Imitations are out there. Please don't assume that all are as bad as those you have played.</desc>
    <desc>The last and most important part of the mud is PK. Everyone should remember that his is WAR! No one is safe, and everyone is a target. The question you must ask yourself... Are you willing to fight and die for your beliefs?!</desc>

    <desc>On the south coast of Estria, between T'shombe Forest and the Great Ocean, rests the island city state of Anaj Naiesta. From the islands of Dhynara, in the east, come ships bearing spices and other wares. These diametrically differing cultures render Anaj Naiesta a place of unsurpassed diversity. It is  in this city that we set the scene.  Dark Prophets MUSH is a game focusing on quality role-play in an interesting environment. The theme is original, a tale of generic fantasy juxtaposed with an Arabian Nights style culture, and features despotic prophets, brave warriors, independent artists and wise sages. The game deals with the eternal struggle between the light and the dark, between what is right and what is wrong.  It should be noted that DarkProphets does NOT employ a combat system, an econ system, or even a magic system. This is an RP by consent mush, where we believe that through a minimal amount of code we can achieve a better quality of free-form rp.  That said, player backgrounds are encouraged after a player has been with us for a few weeks, and code does exist for taking care of that.  (Mailing List: darkprophets@yahoogroups.com )</desc>

    <desc>Quests vary between the, 'beat up this monster and nick its loot' type and the 'how the blazes do I make this pedestal work correctly?' type of puzzle.</desc>
    <desc>The humour could probably be described as 'quirky' or even 'downright odd'.</desc>

It's a wonderful slice of America, even if the occasional villain decides to smash into the convenient store just as you've gone to grab some groceries. Be patient! A hero will be there in no time to save you...</desc>
    <desc>The Proving Grounds is an original-themed super hero MU*. Within the small city settlement of Pecan Valley, heroes and villains try to prove themselves worthy to join more global efforts to save or destroy the world. They hide themselves with secret identities and disguises, but when the clarion call sounds, heroes don their tights and villains brandish weapons. Come be on one side or the other, or stand in the middle as a civilian and watch the action fly!</desc>

    <desc>We've been around for some time now.  DBStar is a mud where we emphasise having fun: There is a strong roleplay streak running through the mud that links with a 'fallout' style perks system, and a jobs system that is reminiscent of Final Fantasy games. A ship system, Housing systems, an extended stats system, hiscore boards, customized equipment, a dragonball wish system, extensive race and skill options, a skill capsule system akin to 'Dragonball Z : Budokai', rewards for dogged players, over 180 skills split between over 10 races, unique abilities like bodyswap, egg laying and genocide attack, poll and voting systems, and a unique 'train' command.</desc>
    <desc>There is no limit to player statistics, with technically infinite hitpoints and kipoints available, and players can indulge in side-missions, roleplaying, item hunting, and more real-life tasks, such as fishing, and creating their own items. Roleplay is automatically rewarded by the MUD, and the points gained can be used in a number of ways - Including Fusion. Points earned from completing missions goes towards jobs, or small rewards, like power increases or items.</desc>
    <desc>Now on a new, lag-free server with 100% uptime, we guarantee that playing DBStar will be one of the best things you've ever done!</desc>

    <desc>For those of you brand-new to Mystical, we are a heavily modified CircleMud, with a fantasy/medieval theme. We are very newbie friendly, and offer a wide variety of classes/races, and an extensive selection of zones, skills, and spells. We offer limited PK to those who wish to PvP. We have a mature theme, and a staff of very skilled and dedicated builders and coders who continually make advances and improvements. Roleplaying events, such as Quests, offer a system by which the purchase of special equipment may be obtained (using Quest Points), and social events are held regularly for both fun and quest points as well. Here, friends made last a lifetime, as the MUD has many players who have been here longer than a decade.</desc>
    <desc>In the realm of Mystical, Darknights wage war against Paladins, Dragons soar the skies, and everywhere the struggle to gain power goes on. Alone, or with your comrades, you may seek power and glory with your blade, your spells, or both. Let the death cry of your foes be your battle song. Adventure, explore, battle, and overcome!</desc>

    <desc>For every adventurer, there was some point in time where you were a hero amongst the common-folk. You were a well-known, admired, and respected figure in your mudding community. It wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to say you were writing your own legacy, but you just never realized it until it was over. You've longed to recapture that magic, but never knew, deep down, if it was possible.</desc>
    <desc>It is now.</desc>
    <desc>AnimeMUD has been an anchor in the mudding community for the last decade. Everyone has tried taking a shot at it, which had caused a lot of unnecessary changes, and a lack of stability. With any online MUD, a lack of stability leads to impending doubt. The doubt is over.</desc>
    <desc>The current owner has IMPed for the last 2.5 years on AnimeMUD, and Mudding for 15+ years. Don't expect this place to go anywhere. Ever.</desc>
    <desc>AnimeMUD offers revamped races, all perfectly balanced (it was a long time coming for that change to occur, previously). There's a brand new 'Adventure Point' system that overthrew the Quest Token regime. Humans have a chance to evolve to a Demon or an Esper, and Sayajins have a chance to evolve into a rare Super-Saiyajin evolution.</desc>
    <desc>Clans, Global Quests, Pk-Quests, a brand new 'Wish List' character upgrade system available on the Autoquest list. We have it all. There's a reason AnimeMUD has been here since the beginning. Jump on the bandwagon, and get ready to write your own legacy!</desc>

    <desc>Sword of the seeker was started to give fans of the book series (Sword of Truth) and television show(Legend of the Seeker) a game world to play in. Most of the mud is true to the world of either the show or books, or both. Some things however, we feel would be lacking if we translated directly to a Mud setting, so there may be inconsistencies such as fantastical creatures and some classes and abilities never mentioned in the canon world. However, we think will these will only serve to enrich and add to the mud world we're re-creating. Thanks for reading, and we hope you'll join us!</desc>

Some classes, like cleric and priestknight, fully depend on chosen god. Following a God gives additional skills, but makes you depend on your faithfulness, and on status of your Temple. Temples can be raided by followers of an enemy god, and you might loose recall and most of your prayers won't work until you re-raid.</desc>
    <desc>We have unique area set and solid world concept with creation story, map and such. No Midgaard. You can choose a town to live in.</desc>
    <desc>We have quests, both automated and provided by immortals. ANSI Colors are configurable. You can choose a different color for every channel, and for many events, like someone using a certain skill.</desc>
    <desc>Mobs and even some items act wise, and there are many quests within our areas. You won't get bored. Race/Hometown/Class/Religion combinations provide enough different roles for you to play.</desc>
    <desc>If you are new to online RPGs, that's the right place to start - Adventurer's Guild makes it's easy to learn to play. If you are an expirienced player, and tired of countless stock area bases with no concept, nothing new to explore and no role to play - Fandra will be a pleasant surprise for you.</desc>

    <desc>Based upon a heavily modified Emlenmud, Fate is a PKmud in which the forces of Good and Evil fight for supremacy. We offer a large variety of races, each with their own advantages.</desc>
    <desc>Besides the skills and spells available to everyone, our class-system allows you to specialize in a profession as you gain more experience. Upon choosing your profession, you gain access to specialized spells and skills. There also are numerous guilds, each offering a unique bonus.</desc>
    <desc>Numerous areas, filled with dangerous monsters and quests make this a challenging place, even for the most experienced players. This makes choosing your allies very important: In fact your survival often depends upon it.</desc>
    <desc>While death is not a permanent thing for normal charachters, we offer the more daring players the ability to play a 'hardcore' character. While this offers several large advantages over normal players, dying means exactly that: Your character is gone forever.</desc>
    <desc>Join the struggle and choose your own Fate.</desc>

    <desc>Lands of Delusion has so much to offer. Unlike other MUDs we are the true Final Fantasy fanatics that started basic and built our way to what is now a great MUD. If you like Final Fantasy this is the MUD for you. The MUD has a great unique touch as well as an easy to understand feel. Aside from players and immortals being friendly and the areas being well known, there is alot more to it then that. This MUD has more then just PK, leveling your character up, casting some magic and just running around killing time while chatting. We offer CHOCOBO BREEDING, CLANS/GOVERNEMENTS (with divisions that hold ranks), new STAT SYSTEM, new LEVELING SYSTEM, new HELP FILE system, a very unique MATERIA SYSTEM, a VERY LARGE over view WORLD MAP, and much more. Did I mention everything within this MUD is completely themed from Final Fantasy? The areas are built straight from the games, 21 Final Fantasy races, 5 Final Fantasy clans, 8 Final Fantasy classes, random encounters (depending on your location), save points to recall back to that location, many channels to chat through, and much much more. The MUD is in BETA, so for you players that want to get a jump start on the others, get the feel for the MUD before it opens. Log on, chat a bit, explore the world of a true Final Fantasy themed/based MUD.  We are currently working on adding Triple Triad and Chocobo Racing.</desc>
    <desc>Any questions just ask me (Havoc) at AIM: HavocLoD, ICQ: 179735277, or log into the MUD and find out for yourself how great this game is.</desc>

    <desc>The Final Challenge began in March of 1994, and is more commonly known to those who play it as TFC or 'the mud'. It has a dedicated, addicted, &amp; friendly player base from all over the world that enjoys meeting new people and interacting.  TFC attracts a variety of types of players. You'll find players who place a heavy emphasis on role- playing, those who are PKers, those who enjoy the puzzles, challenges, and mobmasteries in the game, those who enjoy exploring the almost entirely unique 12,000+ room world, those who like to sit and chat, &amp; those who are a mixture of all of the above.  And you won't get lost in the crowd - since there are generally 20-30 people online at a time.</desc>
    <desc>TFC has a god-follower system and a variety of alignment flavors that a character can choose from.  Of course, characters can also go it on their own and remain unaligned.  Characters may dual and triple class as well. Players may also have multiple characters (and many do), so long as they are not online at the same time and are played as separate individuals.

    <desc>Welcome to Final Fantasy MUX! The game officially opened in the late nineties and has seen hundreds of characters both original and from the games, and certainly dozens of players whom have come and left their mark. Some have remained, some have moved on. That, though, is the beauty of the game.</desc>
    <desc>Final Fantasy MUX is a living, changing world where the actions of a dedicated player can change the face of the world's balance of power. Major political and social changes can and do happen, and players are encouraged to get active, take initiative, and become a part of history.</desc>
    <desc>The game is currently in its third generation of management, currently placing emphasis on the fact that FFMUX is a player’s game. Plots of every scale, both player and staff-driven, political and social movements of unprecedented size, and a community both dedicated and driven are at the core.</desc>
    <desc>Now is your best opportunity to become a part of that world and place your story in the pages of history!</desc>

    <desc>Final Realms offers many things that you will not find anywhere else.  Our world contains over 25,000 custom made rooms.  Each race has their own city and language, as well as a common language that can be understood by all players.</desc>
    <desc>Unlike other MUDS, you will not find yourself maxing out your character within a week or two and growing bored.  We do not have a level limit that is even reachable within several years of play.  You will always be able to continue to grow and gain in power for as long as you choose too.</desc>
    <desc>Each character selects a race and guild from a vast assortment, and will learn a different variety of abilities and spells based upon your choice.  Players may also choose to reincarnate at level 21 for a chance to become a special race that cannot be chosen, although all reincarnations do not go well.  Players earn a title related to your development, rank and player-elected status with the option of hiding your title to keep your guild a secret.</desc>
    <desc>Final Realms also differs from others with built in systems similar to settings you would find on different clients for targeting, name coloring, movement, status window and other things to close the gap for players who have to use telnet.</desc>
    <desc>Players may create, organize and expand their own groups that are dedicated to specific purposes.  There are also many existing Clans, Groups, Houses, and Families that players can join, control and advance in rank.</desc>
    <desc>There are several hundred quests that populate Final Realms with puzzles, mazes, keys to find and doors to unlock.  Artifacts of great power and treasures of incredible value are guarded by dragons, demons and a vast assortment of other foul beasts.  Quests come in a variety of ways that will test your characters physical ability, your mental prowess or a combination of both to varying degrees of difficulty ranging from soloable, party or raid.  Magical items, spells and abilities are earned from their completion.  We also schedule and run an OMIQ (Online Mini Interactive Quest) about once every two months.  Always hugely popular with players, these quests offer very rare and powerful items that are only obtainable by winning.</desc>
    <desc>The combat system is highly developed and balanced between melee abilities and spells, making a fun and challenging PK environment. Each guild has there own unique commands and spells that grow in power as the player gains in levels and skills that are not only trainable but are also gained free by performing abilities that relate to them.</desc>
    <desc>If your ready for a truly unique experience, or want the competition we have to offer then login and feel free to ask anyone for assistance.  We are very newbie friendly, and you will be given a newbie tag on creation that makes it impossible for others to harm you until you have reached lvl 18 or exceeded 6 million experience.</desc>

But mediocre 'runners don't last long around here. You wanna stay alive, you gotta be good, mann.</desc>
    <desc>Shadowrun Germany MUX is set amid this chaotic yet lucrative hotbed of the Sixth World, based on the Germany Sourcebook and incorporating Third Edition rules and Expansions. We allow a wide variety of character classes restricted or disallowed elsewhere, including metahuman variants, ghouls, and even shapeshifters. Magical character slots are available, and other shadowrunner archetypes-- fixers, deckers, riggers, street samurai, mercenaries, demolitions experts, intrusion specialists, assassins, melee combat masters, and just about anything else you could think of--are allowed virtually without restriction. So come to Berlin, chummer, and see what it's like running in the darkest shadows to be found in 2061.</desc>

And once in a while, these realities don't just brush past each other; they converge.</desc>
    <desc>Universe Unlimited is a mixed-theme super MUX with a unique, ongoing global TP. The world of UU is one of brave heroes, scheming villains and strange, unexplainable phenomenon. People are filled with both awe and fear at the rise of mutants and metahumans. Odd occurrences across the globe have raised worries about the stability of the world itself. Could these be the end times? The fallout from careless industry? Or is this is the beginning of a new age? Universe Unlimited is a world of adventure and wonder, mystery and intrigue.

We have recreated almost entire realms from from Final Fantasy 5, 6, 7, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana for your MUDding enjoyment, with odds and ends from other games. Using a Job System mostly based off of FFT and FF5, and special additions from everything to FF9 to Saga Frontier to Final Fantasy Legend, a player can change their abilities at most any point. We offer a newbie school to teach the intricacies and quirks of our MUD, which we strongly encourage using as this MUD isn't quite like your average MUD. We will also answer questions on the newbie channel that is automatically turned on for new characters, and raising other people from death is quite common. A very play-friendly MUD, with a lot to explore.</desc>
    <desc>As a note, while the descriptors say that we're not adult-oriented (there is no 'adult-oriented' play), the gossip channel is not necessarily somewhere you'd want a young child to hang out.</desc>

    <desc>The time of darkness has begun again. The cold winds sweep out of the north, blowing snow and sleet ahead of it, the outriders of the cold fingers of death clutching at the throats of the unwary, the unprepared. Crossing virgin snow through the Taiga, the warrioress lifts a hand to shield her eyes against the blowing snow oblivious to the shadows unseen and unheard in the snow around her. Tightening the grip on her bow, she continues onwards, the message she carries safely tucked away in a traveling pouch, the seal of the kingdom declaring its urgency. Head down leaning into the blowing snow, unaware that as she moves into the darkening day something even darker than the approaching night now has her in its gaze. Rising up behind her, the ice worm takes careful measure of her, slipping along the top of the snow, freezing it as it moves into a solid sheet of ice beneath it. As the wind drops and the lady-warrior, a ranger by trade, hears the tell-tale snap of ice in her wake, she immediately whirls and comes face to face with the adversary, with icy death.</desc>
    <desc>A mother comforts a small child in the night, explaining away the faint screams as the cry of the wolf, hunting in the blizzard, but she knows the cold truth in her heart. Dark times are again on the horizon and simple folk know better than to try and rise up and challenge the creatures that come with the snow. Turning back the covers in her own bed, climbing in next to her husband, exhausted from the days labours, she says a silent prayer in the night. Hoping and praying - beseeching whatever gods may be for a hero, someone who will come and save them from the darkness as it rises.</desc>
    <desc>Sometimes the simple kindnesses bestowed upon the common people are enough to win their favour, answering a whispered prayer as the snow howls in around the eaves, lifting up a fallen comrade on the field of battle, researching the spell or potion that will save the wife of the village magistrate, miles from the heart of Vintermor and without hope other than what heros may come.</desc>
    <desc>This is the stuff of which reputations, livelihoods, legends are made of.</desc>
    <desc>o - Do you have what it takes to be a saviour to the people?</desc>
    <desc>o - Do you have what it takes to rise up and slay the wicked?</desc>

    <port>4041</port>
    <www>http://jm.eraniss.org</www>
    <desc>This MUD is named Jusenkyo Mordor for reasons which are unlikely to become clear again at the moment. Suffice it to say, the action of the game takes place neither in Jusenkyo nor Mordor. Instead it takes place in a completely unique world held loosely together by conventions of convenience, innumerable influences from the realms of sci-fi and fantasy and just a touch of sanity added in a vain attempt to keep plots moving forward in a line slightly less circuitous than a M.C. Escher painting.</desc>
    <desc>The setting for Jusenkyo Mordor is the floating islands of Eraniss and the surface continent below. New characters first arrive in the crystal city of Girralatia through the Nexus. The Nexus is a strange mass of chaotic magic at a point near many other worlds or universes. It is the Nexus that plucks characters from their homeworld and flings them into this one while subjugating them to undesired physical changes and often not even allowing death as an escape.</desc>
    <desc>Eraniss is a tumultuous place, with imported technology, magic and ideas beginning to spread in a world where native magic is prevalent. Constant new arrivals add to the growing number of denizens, diverse in their culture, ideas, abilities and desires.</desc>
    <desc>Jusenkyo Mordor is a roleplaying MUD (originally based on the Mordor code base though the combat system, spells, stats, etc have been removed as the focus has shifted purely to free form RP).  JM is comprised of a small community of players most of whom take turns in GMing plot events and/or building/administrating a part of the game world.  The result is a unique roleplaying environment where everyone contributes to the evolution of the game.</desc>
    <desc>To help cut down on any OOC chatter within the MUD itself, RP sessions are usually organized on the MUD's &amp;lt;a href=\"irc://eldrasia.dyndns.org:6667/Botmud\"&amp;gt;IRC channel&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (eldrasia.lunarnet.org 6667 channel #botmud) so new players may log in to find that no one appears to be on the MUD at the moment.  That doesn't mean players aren't around for RP, though!  New players are encouraged to pop into the IRC channel as well as peruse the &amp;lt;a href=\"http://jm.eraniss.org\"&amp;gt;online wiki&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; which has information regarding the game world, character bios, recent RP logs and other useful information.</desc>

    <desc>GD2K is based upon the comic book series 'Gold Digger' by Fred Perry. Gold Digger is a mix of fantasy, action- adventure, comedy, and many other things. The main characters include an Indiana Jones type adventurer, her adopted were-cheetah sister, the clone they accidentally created who is a mix of the both of them; an alien from another world; and an eight-year-old boy who is a genius at genetics and has created his own three-person army consisting of a ninja, a magic-user, and a genetically enhanced brawler. The adventurer, one Gina Diggers, is the daughter of an arch-mage father from Earth and a master armswoman/adventurer from the magical realm of Jade. Her sister Britanny is the last surviving were-cheetah, rescued by Gina's father from the brutal were-cheetah/were-wolf war 21 years ago, and brought back to Atlanta with his family.</desc>
    <desc>Gold Digger also includes leprechauns, troll archmages, harpies, evil sentient time-travelling dogs, Altantis, Shangra-La, were-creatures of many different kinds, and much more.</desc>

MUD1 or EssexMUD (as the original MUD is now known as) was developed by Richard Bartle &amp; Roy Trubshaw in 1978 at Essex University, England. Since 1978 MUD has been in constant development resulting in a highly original and fun game that can be played here today.</desc>
    <desc>MUDII is a MUD that is set in a timeless alternative reality. This is a world where you can be who you want when you want. The community at MUDII is large and very friendly, they are always willing to welcome and help out newbies. Quests, Houses (guilds), competitions, events, mud-related online magazines and numerous associated websites are all part and parcel of this incarnation of MUD.</desc>
    <desc>MUDII was created in 2001 to run the game for the community that previously played on Wireplay. MUD2 had been running on Wireplay since August 1997 until the game was closed down there.</desc>

It is a fantasy place for RP with variences in sci-fi technology and a feudal type of society encouraging BDSM type of play/RP. Beauty chargen does not restrict race or abilities-most of everything is up to the player's RP ability. We try to accommodate all players here. We do not enforce BDSM play, or any other kind of play, in OOC area. On the grid, you are likely to see public BDSM displays.  The premise is simple: A magical island has an evil ruler, Masters/Mistresses and slaves. I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. If you want to come and be a furry, warrior, wizard, dragon, cyborg, etc...you are welcome. The island is timeless so there are a variety of  races/types/creeds in play and everyone is also welcome to just come and hang out at the OOC Lounge. So come to Beauty and make it your home.

The base is filled with civilian and military officials from the US, Canada, England and Russia who work together to make Edan into a new world by means of the ARK Project, a biological terra-forming missive to populate the planet with Earth species and a full ecological food chain.</desc>
    <desc>One jump away is the mysterious planet of Unity which offers a large market and bazaar at an interplanetary nexus, a place for respite four the SGC members out so far from home. Also it is filled with many people and things that could help Earth or hinder it in its mission.</desc>

    <desc>The mud offers players a growing list of races, including Human, Elf, Moogle, Half-Elf, Half-Lunar, Kelban and Dwarf. Also, players can alternate between over 60 classes -- including knights, paladins, ninjas, assassins, archmagi, thief, and treasure hunters -- through a system borrowed from Final Fantasy Tactics.  This allows players to select both a primary class and a secondary class, combining the abilities of both.</desc>
    <desc>Four of Squaresoft's most popular games (Final Fantasy 1, Final Fantasy 4, Final Fantasy 5 and Final Fantasy 6) are combined in an already large and constantly growing network of worlds with an overall plot that links all of them.</desc>
    <desc>Although it is currently still under Gamma testing, players and ancients (wizards) are newbie friendly, quests are plentiful, and there is much discovering to be made. Players are welcome to submit ideas, as well as contribute in world wide quests run by the administration. For the avid Final Fantasy fan, or just one looking for a mud to play, this game is definately something to consider playing.</desc>

Travelers and merchants from every world and every plane of existence come together at Terminus Faire to trade their wares, be those goods, services... or information.</desc>
    <desc>Around the Faire, the City of Terminus has sprung forth over the ages. None can remember a time when the Faire and the City did not exist, as timeless as the Corridor itself. It always has been and always will be. Where the Faire is the center of commerce and tourism, the City is where the locals make their home and have their own... recreational activities.</desc>
    <desc>Terminus Faire is where tourist, merchants, and others come together to interact. It is a place where gods and demons consort with the most mundane of the mundanes. It is a place of business... and of recreation - where the powerful and powerless alike can explore their desires. Whatever those desires might be.  Terminus Faire. The end of the line is where pleasure begins.</desc>

    <desc>High up on the mountain, I look out over the land of Emperia and it brings a smile to my lips. Evil, goodness and neutrality all lurk within the races that dwell there. The busy streets of Midgaard are filled with many different peoples, but they all seem to live together in peace. As I look over to Valhalla, I see the gods smiling; even at times lending a helpful hand to mortals in need of help. Many of the creatures have banded together as tribes to help each other out, and they are filled with the comradely and brotherhood of belonging. I have watched these creatures of every race and alignment band together to protect what is theirs. Against other creatures who were bent on tearing their world asunder, even the young heroes of this world will fight for it. This world we call Emperia calls out to those who are looking for a home--you are welcome here.</desc>
    <desc>Emperia is a flourishing mud, with a diverse player base and an experienced staff dedicated to creating a fun and exciting atmosphere for all.  Emperia is continuously improving and some of our features include:</desc>
    <desc>* Flourishing community with active tribes and roleplaying. * Over 100 areas, many revamped, but most new! * Immortal and player run quests; personal quests available! * A tiered remort system to keep leveling interesting! * 20+ unique races with special abilities. * 20+ classes with new skills/spells. * Store your goodies in your very own locker! * Arena to safely battle your friends! * Opportunities for players to build areas. * And much, much, more!</desc>

    <desc>Harshlands is a FREE roleplay intensive, skills-based MUD set on the island of Harn (Columbia Games). Standard 'hack and slash' play is seriously dissuaded, with levels, classes and experience points non-existent. Players can choose to pursue careers, including herbalist, journeyman craftsmen, soldier,criminal, clery, law enforcer and many more.</desc>
    <desc>Players proving to be skilled and dedicated are offered choices that include shop ownership, master level craftsmanship, nobility and many advanced professions. For those unfamiliar with Harn, it is a world based on a composite of 9th-12th century Britain.  The world has over 16,000 original rooms in smoothly integrated universally consistant zones, ten deities, five human ethnic and cultural groups, and three non-human races selectable by players of proven ability.</desc>
    <desc>While the thrust and focus of the game is serious roleplay, the world remains a deadly and harsh environment, where life is risky and death is permanent. Recently upgraded code includes account system, wound-based combat system with wound treatment/infection code, upgraded AI, crafts, and numerous small refinements to promote RP.</desc>

    <desc>4 Dimensions is set at a time after a massive nuclear war has caused great rifts in the Time Warp of Universe. Due to those rifts, generally known as 'Time Traps', you can travel freely between different time periods. Some enterprising people have set up a Travel Agency, making it easier for adventurous Travellers to explore the different Dimensions of Time.</desc>
    <desc>There are 4 main 'Worlds' that you can visit; Pre Historic, Medieval, Old West and Future, each with 100% unique zones - you won't find any stock areas in 4D. This makes our mud especially interesting for those that like the extra challenge of exploring and solving Quests. Even our Mud School is customized, with 4 grades (one for each Dimension) and a unique 'Quest Academy' at the top, teaching some of the tricks of mudding, that usually only very experienced players know about.</desc>
    <desc>At present there are over 200 zones, more than 70000 rooms and over hundred built-in Quests of varying difficulty. Many of our long time players build for us, so the world is growing at a steady rate. With the Quest prizes you can buy some of our special 'features' like crash-proof houses, and personalized equipment, pets, mounts and vehicles.</desc>
    <desc>4D is and will always be totally free to play, although we have more features than many Pay-to-Play Muds. Our remort and skill system is very advanced, allowing you to continuously improve your character. The full potential of the Game only unfolds as you play it, but already in Mud School you'll get a taste of what to expect later on.</desc>
    <desc>So come and enjoy one of the most developed and original free Muds on the net! Some of the content in the zones is a bit 'mature', so this is not a mud for the very young or very prudish.</desc>

    <desc>Based in a Year One universe, XMA offers a somewhat different theme, combining several elements, and veers off into its own direction. At the core of the game is the idea of balance. For every good, there's a corresponding evil. For everyone fighting for a certain dream, there's an opponent bent on squashing it. For the X-Men, it is the Hellfire Club. For the New Mutants, it is the Brotherhood's Hellions. For the Morlocks, its the evil that consumes the underbelly of New York. And for the Brotherhood itself, its the Friends of Humanity and the schemers of the world.</desc>
    <desc>After a tragic accident several years ago, the X-Men and the high school students have fallen under the wing of Magneto, a close friend of their former mentor. Established in New York, they attend the Massachusetts Academy, an Upper West Side boarding school with one of the best reputations in the world. As each group grows more organized, change comes in shocking and new ways. With several forces scheming in the backgrounds, each team will have their hands full in the quest for survival, and ultimately, balance.</desc>

    <desc>Starwars Imperial Awakening (started Jan 2002) is 4 years after Return Of The Jedi. The Empire, run by Grand Admiral Thrawn, is working to not only pull the Empire together, but to win the battle against the Rebel Alliance. Princess Leia, Captain Margo Wethers, and General Crix Madine are dealing with a vast number of victories as the Rebel Alliance, under the direction of the New Republic Council, push towards their goal of forming the New Republic.</desc>
    <desc>The last year has found both Rebel and Imperial forces in a sector of space that had previously been inaccessible. The battle for the Jedi Holocron has been won by the Rebels, and all have returned to normal space now that Nablis is once again shut off from the outside Galaxy.</desc>
    <desc>Much to the dismay of the Empire, the Rebels have gained much while they were occupied in Nablis, and to further concern the Empire, Grand Admiral Thrawn himself has been captured when he returned ahead of the ISD Chimaera in an effort to save Coruscant (which he was successful in doing).</desc>

Some areas have been kept from the original Merc world for players familiar with them.  Our creation team is working to keep the good old Merc Diku feeling with new and custom areas. If you are looking for a simple, fun mud with a good social atmosphere, give HW a spin. This isn't Circle, Envy, Merc II, Rom, Rot, Smaug or other variants of Merc. It's the way mudding used to be. And we like it like that.  We support limited player killing, clans, quests, marriages, chaoses and lots of hack and slash.

    <desc>The Hollow World</desc>
    <desc>The planet of the Known World is not a solid ball like our Earth is. In fact it's hollow. A tiny sun hangs in the center of the hollow, and vast polar openings permit travel between the inner and outer worlds. The interior landscape is called the 'Hollow World', a place of acient mystery.</desc>
    <desc>The polar openings leading into the Hollow World are so huge that their cruvature is very, very gradual. That, combined with the fact that these regions are perpetually shrouded in fog, means that people can travelfrom the outer world to the inner (or vice-versa) without being aware of it.</desc>
    <desc>The interior sun sheds daylight at all times in the Hollow World; night never falls, and creatures susceptible to sunlight (such as vampires)  are rare indeed.</desc>
    <desc>The interior world has long been hidden from the outer world- the few outer-world explores who have found it have either died there, stayed there willingly, or returned without publicizing their discovery. To this day, the existence of the Hollow World is not generally known in the outer world.</desc>

    <desc>The game is primarily role-playing, but is supported by advanced space, combat, skills, and economic systems.  A full commodities market economy is available for those that wish to strike out on their own as freelance traders, merchants, pirates, mercenaries, and spies.</desc>
    <desc>HoloTrek welcomes both experienced and new roleplayers to the game.  Good roleplay is rewarded; players who develop good roleplaying skills will find their characters growing in power and influence.</desc>

    <desc>It is a time of unrest for the galaxy. The Galactic Civil War has ended, but the strain that it caused still weighs heavy. War may be over but the fighting continues - at times just as fierce and deadly as during the height of the Rebel insurrection.  The fledgling New Republic is making small steps at restoring some order to the vast regions decimated by conflict. Bringing together countless unique species and civilizations, under the flag of peace and harmony rather than conquest and submission is a task harder than anyone would have believed.  The Empire is a remnant of its once glorious military. Forced to surrender great amounts of territory to better protect itself, but they have not surrendered their dedication to the ideal crafted out of the evils of Palpatine.  Independents have a greater vision of the galaxy now. Smuggling remains a strong source of income and many believe that it will expand even more now. Pirates operate in the relative open. With both the New Republic and Empire strained beyond compare, pirates are capable of picking and choosing their targets with little fear of governmental retaliation. The Civil War may have ended. But the galaxy has yet to see a time of peace. Conflict is all anyone knows, and they will not see it erased so easily.  The possibilities are endless. This is a time for all to make a difference from the smallest of characters, to the leaders of vast governments. Everyone has a place - and each place is unique in its necessity.</desc>

    <desc>Iconoclast MUD has been in continuous operation since 1996, making us one of the longest-running Cyberpunk/Gothic-themed MUDS on the Internet. We've long been one of the top Sci-Fi RP MUDS listed on the search engines, and a significant portion of our players have been with us since the beginning for that very reason.</desc>
    <desc>Iconoclast is set at the dawn of the 22nd Century, and is based around the people and events associated with the free city of New Aurora. Genetic alteration, cybernetic enhancements, neural interfaces, excessive violence, corporate control, rampant gang and cult activity and a worldwide Matrix are accepted as the norm. The 6000+ room Iconoclast world itself is 100% original, and designed to be realistic without being detrimental to play. The focus is on quality, not quantity.</desc>
    <desc>Our customized code (a Circle 3.0 derivative) encourages role- playing while allowing a more traditional hack-and-slash style of play for those who enjoy that. Combat works differently than on other MUDS; there are no levels or experience points as such, but there is plenty of room for self-directed advancement to high levels of power and influence.</desc>

    <desc>Puzzlebox is a science fiction/transhuman/\"postfurry\" MUCK set in a dreamlike city on a cryptically hyperintelligent megastructure. Most characters are furries with futuristic trappings, but all sorts of strange cosmic beasties abound. Food, shelter, and even healthcare are available at the blink of an eye, so there's nothing left to fight over except for ideas -- and no way to fight over them except for art and seduction.</desc>
    <desc>Puzzlebox is different from many other MU*'s in that it takes place in a richly developed original world, but it's still fairly freeform and loosely regulated. While we hope you'll find our players to be fun and friendly, we also pride ourselves on investing serious thought and, more importantly, emotion into our virtual lives. At its best, Puzzlebox is also a social experiment, a work of collaborative art, a philosophical conundrum, a laboratory for identity play, and sometimes a bit of group therapy. :)</desc>
    <desc>Membership is by application only -- intellectually curious, open-minded people who play well with others, daydreamers and romantics preferred. Please visit our webpage or email functionxor@gmail.com for more information.</desc>

    <desc>Somewhere in Brittany (France) is a magical forest, the forest of Broceliande, home of Merlin, the druid and enchanter. It is well known that Merlin is used to travel through time, but what is unknown of the crowd is that Merlin did setup a magic cave acting like a portal leading to various worlds and epochs... There is one thing in common to the worlds that this cave allows to reach: in these worlds, death is usually not a permanent status and most of the ones who perish by accident do resurrect after a while. It is actually a good thing, because the said worlds are small and closed, very few of their inhabitants being able to escape them... and food is rare, leading to a merciless competition for survival where the predators try to feed on the preys...</desc>
    <desc>Voregotten Realm is a vore-themed, free-form, role-playing MUCK, but it also offers a BDSM-biased area and another area designed especially for macrophiles and microphiles. As far as vore is concerned, you are welcome to RP any kind of vore you want: soft, mild, hard, gory, cooking, consensual or not, sexual or not... anything ! As for the characters' races, all are welcome: humans, furries, scalies... anything fancying you is fair game (we encourage creativity and imagination). The MUCK offers medieval fantasy, contemporary and futuristic / sci-fi settings, therefore suiting anyone's needs.</desc>

Add to that hideous, unthinkable abominations that are the product of irresponsible genetics research and generations of radiation poisoning and pollution. Now imagine that multinational corporations are the only organizations cuthroat enough to have come out of the collapse of civilization with any real collective power, and that there are now no restrictions on them using that power however they like. There are so many ways to die here, and thanks to the corp's technology, you can keep coming back and experience each and every one of them. Not even suicide can get you out of hell.</desc>

    <desc>Once a land ruled by dragons, giants, and powerful immortals, one millennium later the power of magic has been replaced by technology and a powerful corporation pulls political strings from behind the scenes.  A terrible industrial accident creates a time rift joining the two eras of the world of Jhoira together.  Now the ways of magic are returning to the land of the future and time travelers attempt to alter the past with seemingly no affect. However, no one knows for sure since all records of the centuries between have disappeared.</desc>
    <desc>Scourge of Time is mainly a hack and slash mud with optional arena killing and roleplaying.  There are 401 mortal levels, separated into 4 tiers.  Once at 401 players are able to obtain superhero levels.  Once you have 3 remorts you can gain Legend levels which make your character even more powerful. Along the way players mayenter challenges (rebirth/reawakening/ renewal) where theycan gain new spells and skills for their class or (with an etl penalty) gain groups more suited for other classes.</desc>
    <desc>Also: - Casino where you can win questpoints and gold - get precious gems by digging or randomly from certain mobs, use these to improve equipment - lockers - imm run clans - mortal run tribes - if you can't stop questing, you can spend your qp to forge equipment to improve it even further. New: - Group2 skills improved, some 2nd tier mobs made easier - chance to get \"hours up\" spell when you complete quest - removed pkill, added arena areas for those that want PvP.</desc>

    <desc>Over the past 3000 years, the mystified sites of the world had made its way into vanishing from the earth. Slowly, each mark of their existence became nothing but clouded dust. Their ancient civilizations are now nothing but a myriad of fiction. The disappearance of their world as we all know no longer is remembered by most and with knowing this, some fear that whatever hurdle and struggles that they went through over history, we are more susceptible as a human race to repeat it. Some feel that tales and evidence of the ancient civilizations were just made up from hearsay; but then there are some that do not believe that they were even human in the first place.</desc>
    <desc>As time progressed in this century, there has been tales of a stone that is capable of giving the holder the key to the ancient civilizations. Powers of its deepest and strongest of magick is contained within the stone. Most have thought that this powerful stone has been created by the ancients, to allow them to jump across worlds of their reality into ours. Somehow, as legend was told, it did not happen this way, but in fact the land that they arrive from was a utopia for those who felt that they did not belong to fellow Earth. It was an escape among escapes. Lives could start over, races could change, and you could always visit Earth (Common), but would you miss it?

    <desc>However, right now humanity is a very, very small fish in the biggest of ponds. Not only is the new colony, christened Persephone, mankind's first departure from its solar system, but it is also humanity's new centre of alien trade and diplomacy. It is meant to be a shining beacon of mankind's power and progress. The reality, however, is quite different, and the two hundred thousand citizens of Persephone must realise that they are merely pieces on quite a large chess board.</desc>
    <desc>From the Cradle is an originally-themed science fiction MUSH set as the human race takes the biggest step in its long history. It is a political game, with ambassadors, diplomats, and bureaucrats jockeying for power and prestige. It is a military game, with the officers of a virginal and hastily-arranged space force trying to look the great powers of the galaxy in the eye. It is a home for farmers, merchants, traders, labourers, tourists, and wanderers gathering on humanity's first new frontier in centuries.</desc>
    <desc>A character-driven roleplaying game, From the Cradle welcomes all of those who wish to dive into a character on humanityâ€™s final frontier. From the Cradle uses a FUDGE-based stats system, and those familiar with FUDGE can have a character ready in about fifteen minutes.</desc>

Im not gonna stop at the moves that they have in DBGT either, its just to limiting so expefct alot more out of this mud then your gunna get out of others. So far I only have up to Oozaru's or rather if your not a regular japanese speaker the giant monkeys that Saiyans turn into when tehres a full moon, I have custom transformation messages, and We are working on getting in custom fighting moves for added fun. The fighting system is one where you actually have to pay attention while fighting, cause the muds not gonna do your fighting for you. We have alot of stuff finished and the code is clean. Try to enjoy yourselves here.</desc>

With a multitude of quests and exploration we can offer far more than only monster-bashing. The latter is of course provided as well, but beware, combat is deadly to say the very least. Player-killing is somewhat limited, but game mechanics takes care of that. It's part of the game, nothing that is required.</desc>

    <desc>DBE is one of the longest running DBZ MUDs online that continues to expand everyday. This MUD takes a mixture of roleplaying and PK to create an unique Dragonball experience. Each of the races will give you a different style of gameplay while RPing and PKing. Even though DBE is based on Dragonball, that does not mean other themes or influences wonâ€™t exist in the MUD. As the name of the MUD says, DBE is an evolution of the DBZ theme. If youâ€™re looking for a different view on the anime, then you should give DBE a try.</desc>
    <desc>DBE Includes:</desc>
    <desc>* 17 races that make up 4 different race types(Attack, Defense, Healer and All-Around) * 100 skills split between all the races * Skills that upgrade through transformations * 14,000 rooms * 7 planets, Majinia, Outer Space, Afterlife/Heaven and Hell * 80+ quests to set out on * over 4,000 items can be bought, found or created * 7 clans * Weekly events and Double Experience weekends * 24/7 PK Dragonball Hunt * Zones and Bosses that require groups with tanks and healers * PK Wars and RP events held often * Food and water are actually useful by restoring pl, ki and fatigue * Bloodlust which is full PK mode that offers multiple buffs * Houses, custom items and pets can be earned * Optional Newbie Academy with rewards when completed * Multiple types of scouters and radars that show different information * Powerlevel gains kept within range of the Frieza Saga * Level based system with virtually no cap * Dedicated staff, most have been with DBE for years * Freedom of Speech if not being malicious * Newbie friendly environment(ask for Ozma if any help is needed) * Stable server and no intentions of shutting down, DBE is here to stay</desc>
    <desc>If any of that sounds appealing, stop by and join in the fun.</desc>

    <desc>**LOOKING FOR CODERS/STORYTELLERS!!!!**</desc>
    <desc>Welcome to By Right of Blood: San Francisco By Night! A game based off the Old World of Darkness Series. By day, San Francisco is as we all know and love her. Bustling, scenic, tranquil metropolis by the Bay, from the tight streets of Oakland to the shining San Francisco Bay, birds chirp in their trees, children file off to school, business men watch their fortunes rise and fall with the tides. Then the sun sets. A howl pierces the night, and the time is come for all good children to be in bed. This is their time. This is the Devil's time. Everything you think you know, every story you have ever heard about witches, ghosts, vampires, werewolves, and wizards. They are all true. They are all real; they are all out to get you. Brave, eternally vigilant Hunters stand against the ever-deepening tide, their vengeful blades poised to strike back against the forces of darkness, but every night the battle takes its toll. Every night fewer eyes watch over the innocent lambs of sleeping Humanity, every night the Enemy multiply. For some it is a call to arms; pleas to fight ever harder as the odds become that much steeper, that much more impossible. Laughing at their plight, the Vampires of the Sabbat stand in bloodstained victory. The Camarilla is broken. Their homes destroyed, their Elysium kept mobile in order to keep the truth of their weakened numbers a precious secret. The Sabbat, the Glorious Sword of Caine, revel in these war-scorched nights. It is a time like unto the Old Days, with the strongest ruling like gods amongst men and even the weakest having mortals to push around. Even Vampires have to look over their shoulders sometimes. Waiting in the darkest places where even Caine's Chosen dare not look, a new threat awaits. More secretive even than the Mages, to whom everyone could be an enemy, their last sanctuary destroyed, and any mortal is a walking landmine of danger, there exists an enemy none dare cross directly. Its name unknown, its origins only hinted at, a force is gathering that awaits only the appropriate time to unleash Hell itself. Whispers in the quiet reaches of Vampire and Mage society, hints that a true Demon, and who can stand against a creature that has carried the Words of God in its now wretched hands. Moreover, in the crossfire, alone against the sweeping winds of evil, are the innocent, the \"normal,\" those people who lack the sense, the fear, the will to simply, hide in their homes when the sun goes down. Every war has its bystanders, every war zone its casualties, every story its heroes. The Children of Seth, mortal men and women, go about their everyday business well into the night, unaware or unafraid of the horrors lurking about them. Werewolves? Mere myth? Wizards? Long since dead. Vampires? Cute, harmless, emasculated shadows of their former selves for twelve-year-old girls to squeal over, but who will preserve them when the harsh fire of reality burns away their illusions? Come, oh traveler, and join us. Here at By Right of Blood, we always welcome new blood into the fold. Staff and Player alike, we greet you with open arms. Anything we might do to make your stay with us as pleasant as your character's is brutal. We work together to create the world you want, the RP you long for, the stories that will keep you coming back night after night. Our spheres are currently expanding, and we are currently accepting Vampire: The Masquerade, Mage: The Ascension, Hunter: The Reckoning, as well as Mortal and Mortal+ classes. We are currently not accepting Werewolf, and accepting Demon applications on a strictly limited basis.</desc>
    <desc>We are also looking for Storytellers and reliable coders who are familiar with Tiny and able to have reliable on-game time.</desc>

    <desc>At the moment of this submission, we are very new area wise, in fact, we dont even have any original areas! :) We have just finished up with the basic coding aspect, though we are always looking for experienced coders - Now we will begin building the world.</desc>
    <desc>Underworld Evolutions will be set in a modern world - something that has never been done successfully on a rom codebase, but that is about to change. All player testers are welcomed, RP is already in swing. If your intrested in building, drop on in and contact one of the Immortals, they will be happy to hear you.</desc>
    <desc>So, drop on in and give us a try. We'll do our best not to disapoint you, but be forewarned - we are an infant mud. I cannot stress this fact enough. We tend to take things slowly to make sure perfection is achieved, rather then a hastily thrown together codebase. So come and roleplay, and offer your ideas. Hope to see you there.</desc>

    <desc>New York is not your average city. It is a world where the strange is commonplace, magic is mundane and wonders sometimes slip beneath notice. It is a city brimming with heroes, villains and everything in between. Some of these people have their eyes set on global salvation (or conquest), playing roles in galactic diplomacy or challenging otherworldly horrors. But there is another layer to the superhuman community, the ones who call New York their home, their territory or their turf. The ones who do not play a role in the galactic happenings, the world events or even the national news. These are the Heroes of New York. Whether these are heroes to the citizens of the Big Apple, or heroes of their own selfish goals is up to them.</desc>
    <desc>And here on the streets of the city, there are goals a-plenty. The students of the Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters only want to explore and enjoy the city, while the dangerous Friends of Humanity want to end the genetic anomoly that is mutantkind. The Morlocks want only to survive and the Brotherhood of Mutants wants to dominate the city. Members of AIM want their own piece of the world, while the Heroes for Hire want a slice of the pie.</desc>
    <desc>The world fears what's different, and that often amounts to mutantkind. Most people feel that these are non-humans, a species to be watched, feared and controlled to the best of their abilities. The political climate is unfriendly for these mutants, but smiles on heroes that are (or were once) their own: Supersoldiers and those who received their powers from an accident are sometimes untouched by public scrutiny while still others can't help but always be in the spotlight in the worst way possible. What is to come of this city, from this tension and uneasiness?</desc>
    <desc>This is Marvel: Heroes of New York. This is a game based on the street level Marvel Comics characters, before the happenings of House of M, and not necessarily following in the canon's footsteps. Here, it is you who helps write the story.</desc>

    <desc>The Sea of Storms is a Wheel of Time MUD based on very heavily modified SMAUG and is primarily focused on role play.  The code is designed to emulate the world created by Robert Jordan in exquisite detail and provide the basis for an in depth role playing environment.</desc>
    <desc>We are also one of the only true leveless WoT MUDs out there. Advancement is based upon use and observation of skills, weaves, flows, and weapon forms.</desc>
    <desc>Perhaps the biggest bonus, however, is that our timeline is independant from that of the books.  This allows the players at The Sea of Storms to truly be in control of their own environment, and not be subject to the same tired plotline where everyone knows what's going to happen.</desc>
    <desc>Get involved in political intrigue in Cairhien, rise through the ranks of the Aes Sedai, fight alongside the Borderguard, or even just run your own shop.  The possibilities are endless.</desc>
    <desc>Just some of our innovative code features include a totally unique channeling system; an all-original combat system with weapon forms for six different weapons totalling almost 300 forms; there's also multi-guilding, color customization, and weapon and armor forging to match our custom layering system. Other features to be found include a dreamworld, wolfkin, angreal, ter'angreal, and pets/mounts that will save right along with you.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Marvel Unlimited MUX! Have you ever wondered what it would be like to recreate, or rather, reinvent the classic characters you've come to know so intimately over the years? Here, you can do exactly that. While the year is 2001, the newest era of Super Heroes has just begun, Mutant hysteria is on it's upswing, teenagers across the country are spawning powers heretofore unknown. And the populace has just begun to feel the effects of Super villains, and the chagrin of their newfound place at the bottom rung on the evolutionary ladder.</desc>
    <desc>The basis of our theme is that which exists in the Ultimate series as published by Marvel comics, and our system, is not at all dissimilar from most consent based MU*s. Set in the present, characters that would be termed as FCs (Feature Characters), are rewound to their origin point, and that origin, placed into a current day context. This allows for all characters in Marvel comics to be translated here, albeit a bit different then you may suspect. Thor, Iron Man, Magneto, all of whom should make an appearance here, should be recognizable to their canon counterparts, but certain liberties can be taken.</desc>

We have set a world world where your action becomes part of a great plan evolving while you're still there breathing. Aarit will allow you interpret a role without having to following stiffly rules that would limit your imagination and letting you manage the opportunity to create different styles of playing without having to start from scratch if you think you made a mistake to include the initial characteristics. Become a part of a world where peace and quiet now rampant in any place where all sorts of discomfort and hostility is handled with attention from several existing breeds. Rediscover old rivals over the centuries are remembered only through the history books and tales handed down orally, seem to have returned to resume their place on top of the evolutionary chain. Explore the remote forested regions of Karpuram where something dark and evil is gaining strength for the attack and return to be talked about herself. In a region trumpeted for its neutrality and its disinterest to World events, the malaise of a people away and defeated will come to be felt all his anger. Meet Kurooth the centaur, current ruler of Myrmidons Clan and commander in charge of the humanoid races that exist on Aarit who apparently has just opened a general meeting to discuss about some items come from remote corners of the kingdom. Fight against what it considers unfair and defend your rights and those the people you knew during your journey, forming groups and clans to dominate or simply enjoy the best in the World you were born. Play your role at best trying to impersonate the choosed character or take a break in the tavern enjoyng yourself with the other adventurers, remembering that even the simple talking can make your gaming experience unique and unrepeatable.</desc>

    <desc>Galactic Trader is a multiplayer space trading game loosely based on the PC game 'Elite'. It's reminiscent of old BBS door games, but is coded for OpenVMS based Alpha and VAX systems. In the original, players would make money buying and selling goods (some illegal) and evading cops and hostile aliens in the hopes of racking up enough credits to buy a better vessel or weapons. Successful players achieve fame on the high score list. In Gamingmuseum.com's enhanced version, players can now join the Imperial Navy or Galactic Police, or even become a member of the hostile Thargoid race. There are many new ships and new equipment, such as tractor beams and fusion torpedoes. Players can build their own bases and outposts. Capital ships can carry fighter squadrons, and mount multiple laser cannons.</desc>

    <desc>Shoujo-Ai MUSH, running PennMUSH, is centered around the theme of an all female, lesbian world. It is set on a small, isolated island named Yuriba that is located in the Devil's Triangle ( similar to the Bermuda Triangle) some distance off the coast of Japan. The environment is built on a simple reality: \"All life is female.\"</desc>
    <desc>Shoujo-Ai MUSH is largely social RP oriented but welcomes purely social players as well. The MUSH is based on the anime subgenre 'shoujo-ai', or 'love between girls'. While the in character world has it's own culture and history, much of the overall flavor remains anime and manga influenced. The environment is designed to allow a primary focus on social and relationship RP, rather than combat.</desc>

    <desc>The use of quests is extensive with levelling quests and title quests available and more being designed at all times. We use an entirely player driven clan system where they can create and maintain their own groups with options for alliances should they be necessary. Another approved form of player killing is through the use of Assassin Contracts to add that personalised touch to a pkill.</desc>

    <desc>[This game requires a client program, easily acquired from under the homepage link.]</desc>
    <desc>Spellbound is a free online multiplayer roguelike game. To win the game, you must build up a character and live and grow in the Forgotten Realms's City of Splendors, Waterdeep. You must be powerful enough to defeat Bane the Black Lord's last avatar, as he has fortified himself 5000 feet under the city, in the infamous Underdark, and is mustering an army of power unseen before. As you work towards this near-impossible goal, you will chart unexplored reaches of the Underdark, do battle with legendary creatures, and find lost artifacts. And of course throughout your journeys you will encounter many other adventurers -- whether they be friend or foe is up to you to decide!</desc>
    <desc>..based on Angband by Ben Harrison and MAngband by Keldon Jones. If you loved Nethack, Angband, Rogue, Omega or other ASCII-based games of the past, you will love this one.</desc>

    <desc>What if everything, everyone you knew, you suddenly didn't? Your surroundings look as familiar as they did yesterday, the skyline of New York just as you remember it. Yet, something gnaws at you, tickling at the back of your mind to tell you all is not as it seems.  You don't remember what happened to leave you on the outskirts of New York City, without anything but the clothes on your back, whatever is in your pockets or carried with you. Did you hit your head? Was there some sort of skirmish or fighting you don't remember taking part in that left you here? Clearly you weren't robbed, so just what in the heck happened?  There's a train station nearby, and you have the means to buy a ticket into the city or to Westchester. You board thetrain, seeing all the same familiar things you normally notice about the area, as you head home. You maybe even start to see some familiar faces, people you notice every day but perhaps don't actually know.  Then there are the people you do know. Friends, comrades, enemies, even lovers, who may or may not know you. At least, not the you that you are, the you that you remember being. They may have a whole different recollection of you, or none at all. What has happened to you, to those you love and hate?  The Rift has chosen you. Whether it will choose the friends and foes you know or not, remains to be seen.  Welcome to Marvel Universe : The Rift!   The premise here is, pick a character you love, and pick and choose their history! You can use the Movies, Comics, or even the Cartoons! All we ask is that you stay true to the core of the character, for whichever history/ies you choose! You can mix and match!  The Rift has created a place much like the regular Earth most characters know, and whether it's a god seeking some sort of perfection, or a god that's like a kid with an ant farm, one thing remains the same: The Rift only chooses one of each incarnation. One Wolverine, one Ironman, one Spiderman, and so on.  (Original Characters are welcome too!) Are you brave enough to risk falling through the Rift?</desc>

    <desc>The Silver Millennium. A harmonious society spread over the ocean of stars and connected by the planets encircling the brilliant sun. While the sun may be the center of this galaxy, it is the pearlescent Moon that is the heart of this extensive kingdom, under the rule of an angelic Queen. The Golden Elysium, an empire expanding over the verdant land on the Terran planet. An empire that stands beside the Moon, but unknowing of the worlds beyond its own skies. Magic and sword play is what they have in common and it is now that their paths intertwine.</desc>
    <desc>Osaka, Japan. Year 1993. The scene is set at the boarding school for the elite, Osaka Seiko Gakuin, and envelopes around the lives of the students and their lives while attending the educational facility. However, something is amiss; strange occurrences have been happening, things that cannot be simply explained. It is the handful of brave students that will unravel the mysterious events, or will they?</desc>
    <desc>The future of the planet Earth is held within the hands of the Queen of the White Moon Court, who has resurrected the times of the Silver Millennium and created the utopian society of Crystal Tokyo, along with other cities that have been crystalized. While locations of civilization have been reduced from those in the 20th century, this has allowed the remainder of the planet to go back to its natural environments and climates. Technology has advanced, a grand academy arisen to teach those the threads of magical studies, and people live for centuries rather than decades. All was peaceful, until the wisps of Chaos were reborn and darkness started to extend its shadowy clutches toward this utopian society. Will warriors of the light step up to the darkness that looms forth?</desc>

    <desc>The royal family slaughtered, a young man steps in to fill the void, setting a blood-soaked crown on his head.

    <desc>King Osric holds the kingdom, controlling it through force and fear; his Guilds hold commerce in a stranglehold. Fiends prowl outside the walls, and, some whisper, within them as well. Evil rules the streets, and few are those, brave, foolish, or desperate, who dare to walk alone after dark.</desc>

    <desc>'Legend of the Nobles, or LotN, is the mud I call home. With dedicated administration and an incredible coder, LotN runs quite smoothly...</desc>
    <desc>As well as original races, there are many interesting classes to choose from. Be the mighty fighter, or the sly rogue. Be the Paladin, and fight for your religion. Be a Conjurer, and dabble in demon summoning and work with the undead. Be a bard, and play your melodies to influence and inspire others. Be a shape-shifting druid, attuned to nature. Be a mage with the power to enchant armor and weapons. Or be a priest, where you don't fight and you gain experience through healing others and drawing powerful glyphs.</desc>
    <desc>This mud has a pleasant balance between roleplaying and player killing ... With the guild, religion, and noble systems, there is plenty of opportunity for intrigue.</desc>
    <desc>One of the most notable changes this version is the inclusion of permdeath ... will ensure a more realistic atmosphere. Those who do not play permdeath cannot achieve the highest ranks.</desc>
    <desc>I recommend anyone who reads to this to join us. All of our long- time players are always willing to help a new face in any way we can. And right now, with the new version, everyone will start off on even footing, level-wise. So please, come join us.'</desc>

    <desc>The Leviathan has been devouring electricity since November 1, 1995. Since then, many have entered to chase and point lance at its white hump, a medieval/sci-fi hybrid where grave-expressioned sorcerers and bristling warriors make their livings alongside sinister aliens who perform experiments upon abductees in sterile orbiting laboratories.  Here is a world so distinguished from all others, that you will hearken to its wild strangeness with childish fireside interest and awe.</desc>
    <desc>Leviathan features: multi-classing, enhanced limb combat, 9 schools of magic, detailed life skill system, the battle arena, guild wars, player owned shops, player-owned real estate, player-stalking bounty hunter, personalized autoloading equipment, a stable mud-government, mud-commodity stock trading, exacting quality standards, and a friendly family of players to welcome you home.</desc>

    <desc>It was foretold in the Chronicles of Qod, a millenia or more ago in the Second War of Shadoe. The ascension of Agog, the Epoch of Transformation, and the redirection of mortality. The last vestiges of the imperial wars, with Ryadel's failed attempt, and the concurrent fall of Thalos left the great powers scattered and bathed the lands yet tamed once again into shadow. At this crucial juncture did the Herald of Walutzu appear to Incubus, proclaiming the new order, and the city of Korflu rose in its course, forever scarred, but blessed with great resources. From this city rise the great adventurers, the legend-makers of Keilar. Born of a kindred spirit, they journey out and tame the wild places, and what was once forgotten has been rediscovered. These, my friends, these are the heroes of the Forbidden Lands!</desc>

    <desc>Lochness is one of the older muds, but what it lacks in modernization, it makes up for in atmosphere!  Both players and wizards are generally friendly and helpful, especially to newbies.  Geographically, the mud is divided into a multitude of domains, each with a different theme and a different team of wizards working on areas.  There are six distinctive guilds to choose from, and plenty of quests to challenge players.  It is not, and has never been, Lochness' policy to instawiz players, but once a player reaches a certain level, he is presented with the option of either wizzing, or playing the higher levels.  Obscenity on public communication channels is frowned upon, although players may say what they like to each other in private :)  As for the number of people who play Lochness, it is certainly a small mud in that regard, but we look at it as having a 'small town' ambience in which everybody knows everybody else.</desc>

    <desc>Those in power are so rarely accepting of that which they don’t understand. Distrust of genetically gifted individuals, dubbed \"mutants\" increases day-by-day, fueled by anti-mutant propaganda, spread by xenophobic communities all across the USA. Even Westchester and the decade old \"Xavier Institute for Higher Learning\" are not safe from rumors, yet the Institute has managed to stay below the radar. Of course, \"for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction\".</desc>
    <desc>The Brotherhood, led by Magneto, has risen to almost dangerous ranks as they openly fight humanity to take their place above them on the evolutionary ladder. Emma Frost, teaching young mutants at her Massachusetts Academy how to utilize their powers to gain their appropriate place as the new \"Elite\", leads a group known as the Hellions, comprised of her own students. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, that every present and proverbial silver lining. An \"underground\" team of Mutants has emerged, called \"The X-Men\" who openly fight Magneto and his team of Brotherhood. The government run association, S.H.I.E.L.D., maintains control over the more extreme vigilante groups, keeping a close watch on the more dangerous aspects of the world that regular humans are so often blithely ignorant of.</desc>
    <desc>Though some would make the world villainous, those who fight for peace and a peaceful co-existence are ready to rise to the challenge, promoting themselves as those who will stand apart, and stand above.</desc>

    <desc>In the beginning there was darkness...</desc>
    <desc>And then, with a booming clap of Thunder, a majestic city was born. The city, named Prophecy by oracles from a distant land because of the vision they witnessed upon its creation, would grow to be the crown jewel of the region. But in its youth, Prophecy was ruled by Chaos, Lust, and Fury. The inhabitants of Prophecy were as varied as the stars in the night sky. Men and women from every race, creed, and class, flocked to the city in an attempt to fulfill the Prophecy. The Prophecy states that one day, a mortal would arrive within the gates of the city and after drawing incredible power from the land, ascent to godlike status. The Prophecy states that the mortal, in their new infinite wisdom, would rule along side the deities of the land and prosperity would reign over the realm. But then darkness would consume the mortal and they would rage a bloody war against the pantheon of the realm. The Prophecy states that only after a long and bloody war would the chosen one rise above the deities ruling the land and thus fulfill the Prophecy. Some choose the path of the murderer, hunting others and consuming their life essence. Others decided to gain their glory through hunting and slaying the many creatures that inhabit the furthest corners of Prophecy. Over the years, much blood has been spilled as thousands of worthy adventurers have inhabited Prophecy attempting to seize the power that lies beneath her surface. Some historians claim the oracles were mistaken and that the Prophecy is merely a hoax designed to fill the city of Prophecy. But, my friends, I was there when they fled from the city in madness because the power had eluded them. I, myself, could taste the power on many occasions. But time has taken its toll on me and I must abandon my quest to fulfill the Prophecy. Do you have what it takes to fulfill the Prophecy? Are you the chosen one? There is only one way to find out.</desc>

It is a dark time of lost history, where fiends sprung whole from the Mist and tore apart cities, men tore apart nations, and civilization's fire almost burnt out in the dark night of barbaracy.</desc>
    <desc>What is known is scattered and fragmented, and diligent scholarship has only uncovered the facts of the events, but few of the motivations. What is known is that Emperor Larsa of Archadia, citing the evils of manufacted nethicite and the terrible effects it took upon the armies and people of Dalmasca, undertook to destroy the sources of these tainted artifacts once and for all.  It is known that Emperor Larsa and the Queen Ashe went together to the Ridoran Cataract, and the Pharos there. The events of the day are not fully known or understood; and the ruins of the Pharos remain so mist-infested that no ship, air or sea, has dared within ten miles of the island since that day.  Mist poured from the Pharos; so thick it blotted out the sun, until the sky seemed to run riot with the terrible colors. A madness swept the vieran race; a rage so terrible, it is told of only in bloody, hushed whispers. Those few Viera remaining, old enough to have been alive upon that terrible time, bear scars, and few can or will speak of the horrors endured or, often, perpetuated, by them.</desc>
    <desc>Men and women died in the streets; torn apart by Fiends, choking on Mist so thick that every breath became a wild magic. Houses, cities, crumbled, rotted, burned. Within a month, no nation known to the world remained in existence; the centers of power disrupted, destroyed, undone by the mad Mist that swept the world. Races never before known sprung from the Mist, as confused and terrified as any other, having been born into a world gone mad.  How long, precisely, the terrible Mist raged, is not entirely known. The shortest credible estimate is three months; the longest, eight years. The Mist Madness that many endured made most diaries useless; ravings of madmen, moments of lucidity, terrible despair.</desc>
    <desc>Two hundred years have passed since the Larsan Folly, and the city of Emberstrand has risen up near the ashes of Rabanastre. This is where our story begins.</desc>

    <desc>From a distance you behold our world. Peaceful, beautiful continents resting like gems set within an aquamarine sea.  Come closer.</desc>
    <desc>To the east, you see a battle waging on the seas. A ship is locked in battle with a giant sea serpent, the crew frantically manning the guns and striving to hold the ship together in face of the onslaught.</desc>
    <desc>Many miles to the north, in another part of the sea, several clans have gathered their strength to do battle against the Khrait, a mysterious, powerful race that has recently begun to invade our lands from Afar, in the first skirmishes of war that will change the face of Medievia.</desc>
    <desc>In a few parts of the world, life continues almost serenely.  Clans prepare to build their businesses; traders venture between the great cities of our land in endless search for profit; dragons soar through the sky, bearing adventurers out to hone and test their skills, in the hopes of becoming worthy of the title Hero.</desc>
    <desc>But look closer still, at our faces. See the anticipation, the fear and excitement, as each one of us faces the fact that the struggle we're engaged in will determine the destiny of our entire world, and of each of our souls.</desc>
    <desc>Gold and glory, battle, adventure, triumph, defeat, Good, and Evil... all await anyone with the strength of spirit to come forth.  Our history is being written. Are you strong enough to join us?</desc>

    <desc>END-OF-LINE is based on the film TRON. But it begins where the film ends. The Blue programs have just managed to break the MCP's strangle hold, but there are still pockets of Red programs resisting. The MUD is based on the war between these two sides. You can choose which side to join, and what role to play in each army.-----There are two main roles: generals and troops. The generals manage troops and resources, transport them between areas, and decide which areas should be attacked. The troops fight individual battles. There are NPC generals and troops on both sides, as well as interactive generals and troops.  These players can join and leave at their leisure.-----The distinguishing thing about the MUD is that it involves 3 levels of play, which interact: (LEVEL 1) is involves playing a general managing resources in a war. This is very strategic and is like Chess but more closesly like X-battle. (LEVEL 2) involves commanding troops in a battle. This is like a game of Command and Conquer, you can see a map with the troops and position them. (LEVEL 3) involves close range fighting. This is the level which players familiar to Player Killing will recognise. It is likeplaying a shoot-em up like DOOM.</desc>

A cool breeze blows and you feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand at attention.  Something is awry, yet you just cannot put your finger on it.  As the bell tolls, you notice a pair of sharp, gleaming eyes and a flash of what look like razor sharp claws in the brush.  As you draw your sword, you are knocked off balance from behind.  When you arise, you are facing what could only be one of Hell's creations. You turn to run, but you are faced with another foe; the true Champion of Gaia.  All around you are gathered strange creatures; all of which hunger for your head.  They sense your FEAR.</desc>
    <desc>FearMUD is not your every day hack-n-slash pure PK mud.  Here at FearMUD we strive to bring forth the most to the table.  We have a large selection of classes, some custom, some re-written, and some GodWars original with some tweaks.  We have a unique character advancement system which offers hours of play.  Be warned, FearMUD is not a '10 minute and you're maxed' MUD.  Within hours of beginning, one may join the PK and not just watch it.  Just remember, the more you put into your character here, the more you get out of it.</desc>
    <desc>There are also many custom features added to this mud. - Purchasable permanent hitroll, damroll, damcap, and toughness (all status related to promote pk) - Unique areas - A comprehensive channel history system...

    <desc>Miami by Night, up since January of 1997, is a World of Darkness(tm) MUSH set in Miami, Florida, in the first decade of the 21st Century. We support the following second edition systems: Vampire: The Masquerade(tm), Mage: The Ascension(tm), and Werewolf: The Apocalypse(tm).</desc>
    <desc>Our Staff prides itself on its fairness, and players can be assured that the rules are enforced equally. Each player is just as important as every other player and staff will not step in to retcon or rewrite scenes to benefit any particular player's 'story' over another's. If you like a game where scenes are not prescripted and you will not be prevented from action as long as you have IC justification, then Miami may be the place for you.</desc>
    <desc>There are no quotas for Supers (vampires, shifters, mages, etc.) on Miami by Night in order to give players the chance to play the type of character they want, although each player is restricted to one Super. Mortal character creation uses Mortal Peer stats, meaning a starting stats mortal has the same starting attributes and abilities as a neonate vampire. Transfer characters from other MUSHes in the same general timeline are accepted, provided we can verify stats. More information on character creation and transfer can be found on our web site or by logging into Miami by Night.</desc>

We have innumerable unique features, ranging from what has been called the finest player vs. player combat system in existence, to a realistic weather system, to lucrative trade skills, to endless opportunities for roleplay in the intricate struggles that take place daily within the land.</desc>

There are several mortal classes, and when a player has exhausted a career path, they have the opportunity to become one of four remortal classes, and learn more powerful skills and spells. There are currently seven clans on Chaos Empire. They each have their own clanhouse, equipped with a store room and a board. Each clan also has its own special abilities, which are generally very powerful (some are spells, and some are character bonuses).</desc>
    <desc>Newbie Helpers are there to help new players, new mudders and experienced players alike which are just starting out, if no Newbie Helper is on an Immortal will be happy to help you get started.</desc>
    <desc>The main city is custom to Chaos Empire, and should provide a refreshing  change to other MUDs. We aren't a large MUD, so there won't be hundreds of people on at any time, but the people on are, in general, friendly and will help you if you ask nicely :-)</desc>

    <desc>The beginning came five hundred years ago as the Earth-That-Was resources began to dry up. Those that could leave, did. Those that remained, well, they didn't quite have a choice with what happened next. A new solar system was found, and terraforming offered the means to create new earths. As time grew on, so did the new era of humanity, and with that comes that of disputes. A war broke out between the Alliance and the Independents. He who wins the war, writes the history book, and well - the Alliance won. Times have changed, and humanity continues to develop. Technology inspires us to build greater things, and so we do. Each of us has a piece of this pie within the 'verse, whether small or great, we're all here to enjoy it until we can't breath any longer. The choice is that of the person's, whether they want to do something with that pie or simply sit on it.</desc>
    <desc>Gorram MUSH is based off the theme of the Firefly episodes &amp; Serenity movie. Set five hundred years in the future &amp; western mixture, its a big verse to explore out there. Roleplay is set as the priority with plenty of opportunities for someone to place their own niche in the 'verse. Code is in place to simply enable a person with their story, instead of inhibiting them. Opportunities are available to play a wide variety of different types of characters, everything from Companions to Shepherds to Pilots, and everything in between. Familiar worlds from the game are present to explore, make your home or even business on. Variety of ship types are available for a player to purchase, and there's a coded space system that allows for those that wish to explore the open black to do so.</desc>
    <desc>If you're looking for a good roleplaying environment, whether new to the theme or a dedicated 'browncoat', Gorram MUSH offers a home to those players that are looking for a place to simply come and RP.</desc>

    <desc>You would be able to choose among two races, Ningenteki (humans), or Konpaku (souls).  The classes for Ningenteki are Ningenteki (human with special powers), and Bauntou (soul devouring vampires).  The classes for Konpaku are Konpaku (spirits with a chain attached to their chest), Kaizou (modified souls), Hollow (evil spirits), and Shinigami (soul reapers).  Also, you would be able to pick a family name from the show upon creation (Kurosaki, Inoue, etc.) that would grant you special abilities.</desc>
    <desc>Use your powers as Shinigami with your own Zanpaktou and a wide range of spells to protect the world from Hollows, use your powers as a Ningenteki to aid the Shinigami in the defense of Kankuro Town and Soul Society, or just become a Hollow and spread chaos and terror, feed upon souls with strong reiatsu (spiritual pressure), and joining forces with Aizen to destroy both Kankuro Town and Soul Society to obtain the Key to the ultimate power!!!</desc>
    <desc>Right now we are in the pre-alpha development stage.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  We are hiring builders and coders. Any help (ideas, building, coding, etc.) would be rewarded with mission points, special gear and weapons.  We want this mud to be the best BleachMUD on the network and all of you play an important roll in it.  BANKAI!!!</desc>

    <desc>A stone castle rises from the top of a huge rock floating high up in the sky, shifting from plane to plane. Its inhabitants struggle under the dying curse of the architect, whom they betrayed and murdered. This castle, now named the Ark of Fools, carries a few score refugees from the broken remains of what was once a city in the Astral Plane, along with victims drawn in from across the multiverse by the Curse. Mysteries lie at the heart of the Ark. The Old Man built it for a purpose. What was it? Can the Ark be wrested from his control in time?</desc>
    <desc>Drawing inspiration from sources including the legend of the Flying Dutchman, the painting \"Castle in the Pyrenees\" by Rene Magritte, Star Trek, and Laputa: Castle in the Sky, our principal aim is to enjoy traditional D&amp;D (3.5) fun in a fantasy setting, with plenty of staff-run plots and dungeon-delving. The current incarnation is a sequel to the original 3.0 version of Ark of Fools MUX.</desc>
    <desc>Ark of Fools MUX is a tabletop-style game, with players meeting at regular times. Most sessions take place weeknights from 8-11 pm Eastern time.</desc>

    <desc>Mirkwood stared in 1995 and is still going strong. Famous for its social atmosphere, its inspired areas, and its professional coding, Mirkwood is a dynamic and active MUD undergoing almost daily code modifications. Recently, the coders implemented an original remorting system and added six new classes. But the largest recent change was a complete remapping of the world that involved splitting the land into two continents and creating an extensive road system. Mirkwood's original and extremely powerful object, room, and mob scripts aid builders in creating immersive areas, many of which are based on the writings of Tolkien. However, Mirkwood's player and immortals are far too eclectic to stick to one theme. The battle-scarred moon Daktor, the red-neck Trailer Park, the magic-loathing city of Pelios, the vast and deadly Ocean, and scores of other areas all await the stalwart adventurer. Mirkwood's custom-designed area builder (Mac/Win) supports the continuous development of new areas. If you love the community of your fellows, join one of Mirkwood's eight tribes, which have huge castles and keeps; their own channels; custom time and weather messages; internal security; shops for armor, weapons, food, and tokens; recall rooms; healers, trainers, and guild masters; and access to a tribal arena.</desc>

The immortals of this realm try their best to be responsive to the players by listening to complaints and ideas. Most ideas or proposed changes get implemented if they are found beneficial to the entire mud. The players are cordial and happy, and often communicate extensively on our many channels.</desc>
    <desc>LUN, as it is called for short, offers 12 races and 12 classes and a variety of features too numerous to name. If there is a feature you want that we don't have, please feel free to let us know! We have left the original customization in, though most prefer to use the base skills and spells each class has in. We also offer an alternative mud school for players who are familiar with the rom code, as well as offer the stock mud school for new mudders to learn from. We are in the process of adding new original areas to eliminate the stock to give known mudders new lands to explore.</desc>
    <desc>One thing that we do pride ourselves on is our complete and up-to-date help files. This makes us a good choice for new mudders and those who are sick of having to ask about everything. There is also a question/answer channel on the mud for questions that you can't answer through help files.</desc>
    <desc>LUN has a religion system of nine separate religions, each is led by a fellow player, and follows a mythical god and ethos.</desc>

    <desc>A Moment in Tyme (MiT) is one of the oldest Wheel of Time based Muds on the Internet.  Since 1994, our coders and builders have been working hard to bring in unique new features and our own original areas.  MiT is currently on our second major revision of the codebase, and our areas are all completely original.  At A Moment in Tyme, we have a dedicated playerbase and an excellent, committed staff of Immortals.  We have unique systems in place to rank players' mastery in swordplay and channeling (Wheel of Time's magic system).  A Moment in Tyme is set on a Timeline that is based on the first six books. After that, though, Tyme has broken away to become a mirror world of the books. The Bowl of the Winds has been found and used, breaking the long winter. Elayne has returned to Andor and taken the Throne. After a long struggle, Analinde su Riaten Rie now controls Cairhien with Rand al'Thor's, the Dragon Reborn, approval.  The White Tower has split, but after a Black Tower raid against the Aes Sedai, Elaida has been kidnapped and now awaits trial before the newly reunified Tower. Who will be Amyrlin now? Already several woman are seeking the title.</desc>
    <desc>And the Seanchan? Tarabon, Arad Doman, and Altara are all victims of the Ever Victorious Army. The High Lady Suroth invaded, and conquered Murandy, instead of reaching into Amadicia. Because of this, High Lady Ilorin Shayndel Paendrag, fourth in line for the Crystal Throne, has officially settled into the Panarch's Palace and taken control of the Hailene. Who will stop them? Word is that a mercenary group called the Heron Company is being raised to retake Arad Doman...  A Moment in Tyme is a RP-intensive MUD. We have an RPexp system which rewards RP by giving EXP based on emotes. Combat Code is currently offline, as it is being completely remodified and built from the ground up. It will utilize 50 different body parts as well as have very realistically coded forms with special procedures.</desc>

Hands raised over the meager heat, a multitude of wretched forms shiver as tattered wet clothes cling to their bodies, leeching the strength from even the hardiest. Nearby, in a small park a tiny child looks out into the shadows, her vision blurred by tears, desperately searching for her mother. A flicker of movement catches her attention and she looks up to see the bushes at the edge of the clearing part. Her scream echoes through the open window of a luxurious basement apartment. There is no one to answer her cries for help. A crumpled body leans heavily against the desk, an expanding pool of blood staining the immaculate Armani suit and the letter clutched in a hand white as ash.

Mordor's unique multi-class system, along with its remort classes and extended race selection, allows you to completely customize your character. Role-play as good or evil and engage in player vs. player battles by joining an alliance such as the Eye of Sauron, the Hand of Saruman, the Haradrim, the Last Alliance, the Northern Rangers, or the White Council.  For riskier adventurers, Mordor also offers a few independent guilds where you may participate in player vs. player combat without the loyalties or protection of an alliance.  We also have an alliance dedicated to helping newbies - the Guardians of Mordor.  All alliances are ever evolving by expanding their halls and adding new equipment.  We have a full time Quest Master and often offer unique Immortal run quests.  The Immortal staff is constantly building and programming new features for Mordor, and the player base consists of many different characters.

    <desc>Do you have a favorite video game? Do you have a soft spot for an old SNES RPG? There's a good chance we have content based on it. The game world is an amalgam of areas from all sorts of sources. And I really do mean all sorts: Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Super Mario World, Mega Man, Earthbound, Secret of Mana, Ocarina of Time, Tactics Ogre - even Harvest Moon and River City Ransom.</desc>
    <desc>But there's more to the Cleft than just references and nods to games. We have a world full of secrets to discover and treasures to claim. Quests involving tricky fights and trickier puzzles, not just \"i vant you to keel seex snow moose.\" Boss battles that could knock your socks off if you happen to be wearing socks. We have lots of content with lots of depth, and even if you consider most MUDs tedious, shallow grinds, I think you'll find satisfying gameplay here.  We're the only game in the world where you, an alien, and some oysters can team up to fight superpowered pokemon.

    <desc>Mozart is one of the oldest, most developed muds on the net. Our world has over 28,000 rooms in 200 zones among three major areas. The Surface is the largest and most newbie-friendly. Beneath, the svirfneblin city Galtherdelve and the drow city of Aluhryn in the Underdark are more dangerous, and player-killing is legal.</desc>
    <desc>Mozart is rent-free. While in other muds it may cost you gold to keep your items, here we make our players want to play instead of punishing them for being away. Further, we use a percentage-based loading system instead of object limits, so it's impossible for a small number of players to hoard all the best equipment.</desc>
    <desc>All the major features of mud clients, including aliases, speed- walking, and command history, are provided by the game itself, so all our players - even those on telnet - are on an equal footing.</desc>
    <desc>Mortals may advance to level 99 in 14 different classes and more than 400 skills, spells, and specialties (which resemble feats in the D20 system). After 99th, there are 11 avatar levels each with a skill, spell, or power specific to each class.</desc>
    <desc>Mozart's code is very stable and very highly featured. We rarely go less than two weeks between reboots, and we recently broke our record with a four-month-long uptime. Crashes are quite rare, and new code is well-tested before it gets anywhere near our players.</desc>
    <desc>Immortals have access to full OLC including every feature we can think of, all the way up to LP-mud style scripting. If you have a new idea, we'll work to make it possible.</desc>

    <desc>A terrible plague killed about 97% of the world’s population in 2009. Now, almost 20 years later, Boston Massachusetts has become a major metropolis populated by survivors. The control of the government and their propaganda are impossible to escape. Travel to and from the other few populated areas of the United States is dangerous and deadly.</desc>
    <desc>The Reformed Republic now mainly consists of three rebuilt cities; New Boston, New Providence and New Hartford. Within the game setting, most people crowd in the center city, New Boston, and enjoy the comforts of technology and the protection of the military. The less fortunate must scrape a living in the outskirts, living without electrical power or the benefits of law enforcement. The contrast is sharp, but nothing is ever in black and white.</desc>

    <desc>MUME is a free multi user role-playing game based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Middle Earth' that has been continuously running since fall '91.  The action takes place in the late Third Age, before 'The Hobbit' and after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key of Erebor was just found by Gandalf and all the epic tales narrated in 'The Lord of the Rings' may take place.  MUME covers 23'000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of Lhï¿½n in the West to the fringes of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South. In this meticulously crafted world where fantasy tales come to life players may join the War between the forces of the Dark Lord and the armies of the West.  MUME VIII is written in C and in mudlle (a functional language that was developed in order to allow on-line extensions to the game).</desc>

From the moment you set foot in the Realms, you will be enchanted by the vivid, full ansi color descriptions, and the highly intricate, refreshingly logical and internally consistent structure to an extent which you have undoubtedly never before experienced.</desc>
    <desc>Realms of Chaos runs on its own machine and connection, and is incredibly well-balanced and fair.  Anti-cheating rules are actually enforced.  You can therefore be proud of your achievements on RoC, as people do not gain levels by exploiting bugs or imbalances.</desc>
    <desc>RoC is a challenging mud.  Those looking for a place they can become powerful overnight will be disappointed. However, it is the perfect mud for someone looking to earn their levels, and to be able to take pride in making it to High Mortal, because it is not something just anyone can do.</desc>
    <desc>When you check out RoC for yourself, you will see a well developed fantasy world that has room for humor and parody.  It is not just a mud; to those who know it, it is another dimension.</desc>

    <desc>New York is not your average city. It is a world where the strange is commonplace, magic is mundane and wonders sometimes slip beneath notice. It is a city brimming with heroes, villains and everything in between. Some of these people have their eyes set on global salvation (or conquest), playing roles in galactic diplomacy or challenging otherworldly horrors. But there is another layer to the superhuman community, the ones who call New York their home, their territory or their turf. The ones who do not play a role in the galactic happenings, the world events or even the national news. These are the Heroes of New York. Whether these are heroes to the citizens of the Big Apple, or heroes of their own selfish goals is up to them.</desc>
    <desc>And here on the streets of the city, there are goals a-plenty. The students of the Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters only want to explore and enjoy the city, while the dangerous Friends of Humanity want to end the genetic anomoly that is mutantkind. The Morlocks want only to survive and the Brotherhood of Mutants wants to dominate the city. Members of AIM want their own piece of the world, while the Heroes for Hire want a slice of the pie.</desc>
    <desc>The world fears what's different, and that often amounts to mutantkind. Most people feel that these are non-humans, a species to be watched, feared and controlled to the best of their abilities. The political climate is unfriendly for these mutants, but smiles on heroes that are (or were once) their own: Supersoldiers and those who received their powers from an accident are sometimes untouched by public scrutiny while still others can't help but always be in the spotlight in the worst way possible. What is to come of this city, from this tension and uneasiness?</desc>
    <desc>This is Marvel: Heroes of New York. This is a game based on the street level Marvel Comics characters, before the happenings of House of M, and not necessarily following in the canon's footsteps. Here, it is you who helps write the story.</desc>

The domains in OS represent a planetor solar system in the Galaxy, being linked togher by space ships or other (magical) connections. The level of civilization on each planet differ greatly. For instance Earth is a very hi-tec planet while Aurora is still situated in medieval times. So if you are into si-fi muds or historical muds this is the mud for you.</desc>

Nightfall was founded in December 1990 and now consists of over 500 MBytes of mudlib source code (that means about 80000 Files total).</desc>
    <desc>You can discover a whole new world with different realms ranging from old traditional english mythology like the Camelot of King Arthur to the ancient colosseums of Rome, from the lofty chambers of the dwarvish mountain halls down to the deepest bowels of Hell, and over eleven other enticing kingdoms. At this time, there are approximately 16 open domains and many projects in the making, all with different themes and scenarios.</desc>

    <desc>Nilgiri, the Forgotten World is one of the oldest muds. The code is based on original DikuMUD, and has been heavily modified over the eleven years it has been around.

We strive toward a realm that is realistic within the premise of a magical world.</desc>
    <desc>We offer a detailed law system that varies from city to city, enabling players to police themselves and others. If exploring new lands, slaying dragons, roleplaying, or questing for adventure lies in your blood, come join us and drink your fill.</desc>
    <desc>Some of our unique features:</desc>
    <desc>* Nobility * Multiple starting continents * Multiple cities * Multiple languages * Intricate sea-faring and sea-battle system * Over 44,000 rooms and still expanding!</desc>

    <desc>Nirvana has now been around for a what seems forever. Most of the players and wizards have long term investment in Nirvana and care about it.  Nirvana follows an older style of LPmud with no set theme. The result of this being wizard creativity runing in all directions producing a diverse world where just about anything can happen from couples having babies to adventuring in bowl of jello occupied by strange critters.  Players can have as many characters as they like so long as they do not have interaction between them. (only one can be used at a time) PK is limited to those who wish it and in certain areas of the game. Along with risk free sparing options and other features that allow players to enjoy the thrill of a more lively opponent. That said, there are also NPC's that are almost alive, to where some players mistake them for other players.  Nirvana has had the 'honor' of having other muds try to copy it in whole or part, sometimes using less than honest means to do so. But there can be no true copy, don't accept an imitation when only the original will do.</desc>

    <desc>If you have been looking for a MUD the is original, exciting, and addictive, then look no further.  The Adventurers' Inn is all of that, and much more.  I have been mudding for over 10 years, and I know what it's like to look for a MUD that you can really enjoy.  Some offer great class/race selections, but lack in the roleplaying environment.  Others are pure roleplay, but lack in fun.  When I started The Inn, all I wanted to do was to make a MUD rich in theme, and full of excitement and realism that even I would enjoy playing on.  The Adventurers' Inn is such a place.</desc>
    <desc>All of our InnKeepers have that same desire and drive to build the best MUD possible for our players.  Mobs that interact with the players, objects that aren't mere weapons, but artifacts that old great powers, and dangerous consequences.  Rooms and spells that are lethal, and traps for the unexpecting.</desc>
    <desc>All this and more await you on The Adventurers' Inn.  Come and visit, and stay for the adventurer of your life!</desc>

    <desc>Long ago, before the rise of humans as race powers in the world, there were two great empires, the dwarves and the elves.  The origins are unknown, lost in the mist of the past but two different races would be hard to find.  The elves, thin and elegant, lovers of nature, the sea and great forests, masters of the ethereal magical arts. The dwarves, masters with stone and steel. Architects and sculptors, lovers of the high cold airy mountains. As each grew in strength, they met and clashed.</desc>
    <desc>To this, the human nations came, often caught between the borders of these domains.  Eeking out their existence they too developed their own resourceful culture, eager to take the opportunity of any weakness to secure their place in the world.</desc>

These, with traces of arcane magic behind the stranger things going on, are all a part of what makes its setting. Jipang itself is a small fictional continent, set in 1864 and located somewhere in the pacific ocean around about where Japan is in our world today. Unlike Japan during this time period, however, the people of Jipang are a more open minded lot when it comes to outside people an cultures, having found much to gain from them in recent times.

Unseated by political and social unrest, the clans form and gather amid the storm of chaos befalling the world.  Vampire Wars: The Final Sunset is focused on roleplay and social interaction. Based off Whitewolf's Vampires, The Dark Ages it also offers the thrill and hunt of Pure PK.</desc>
    <desc>New additions to the code, for those familiar with it, include additional disciplines, upon joining a clan you gain three preordained disciplines of that clan as well as up to two other choices based on rank/generation within your clan. Knights/Vampire Hunters are in and ready for players. More changes are to come almost everyday to make the mud better, though the basic framework will stay intact.

    <desc>PhoenixMUD is even better in 2009!  One of the longest lasting MUDs around, it has very few traces of its stock circlemud origins from 1995.  Feel free to role play, explore, or just hack and slash.  The dedicated staff of immortals understands that games are meant to be fun.  They understand that games should be newbie- friendly at low levels yet still challenging at high levels.  And they understand the difference between \"challenging\" and \"tedious\". With these principles in mind, they have made PhoenixMUD better than ever.</desc>
    <desc>* Interactive real time combat. * 404 levels. * Realistic magic system with over a hundred spells. * 15 races and dozens of classes provide for hundreds of race/class combinations. * More intelligent zones, with built in quests and mobs that can surprise even experienced players. * PK battle zones and PK flags that players can purchase to attack only other flagged players of similar level. * Lots of NEW CODE in the last year, including: - Player-owned shops! - Newbie enhancements that gradually decrease as you level. Now new players don't have to worry about finding their way in the dark, struggling to find the perfect leveling equipment immediately, etc. - Automated hero tests for remorting.  Now with triple remorts! - An \"explored\" stat keeps track of what % of the world each player has yet to find. - And much more! *New for 2009:  A triple-zone dedicated to role playing, where emotes have real power and actions have lasting impact.  Tired of hacking and slashing through the other zones?  Get together with an imm and a fellow player or two for a D&amp;D style campaign, heavy on mystery.</desc>

The mud moved around a bit to include a long stint on mudservices (until their odd demise). HercMUD is now located in the basement of one of its imps. Hercules MUD is on code base V (5) now. We have gone through several code changes but still maintain our original goals to provide a unique, family-oriented, friendly, and safe place to relax and enjoy some company, whether playing or just hanging out.</desc>
    <desc>Hercules MUD is a skill and level based MUD. It is newbie-friendly with level-based equipment, some stock but many unique areas, to include a complete Newbie area for beginners.</desc>
    <desc>Hercules MUD is a heavily modified Circle code base which has OLC, DG Scripts, an online mud balancing feature that can adjust the mud without rebooting, an event system for skills, spells, and fighting, an auto-questing feature, a ferry system to get from continent to continent and many more unique challenges for the player.</desc>

    <desc>TUSP is my vision of a new, darker world. One where machinations and subtleties are allowed to blossom, and where roleplay is not merely a precursor to inevitable violence... though violence often finds itself as an element of a well rounded plan.</desc>
    <desc>TUSP is not fully operational, and will not be fully operational in the next several months. This is because before it becomes done, I need to finish recoding creation, destroy and recode the fighting system, remove the old magic system, modify the command system to do what I want it to, and recode all of the skills to actually use the proper abilities and stats. Also, I'm switching it from straight SMAUG over to FEAR, because I think FEAR is pretty nifty...</desc>
    <desc>When done, my goal is to make TUSP be the most accurate, automated WoD mud. If done properly, any of the (official) classes should be able to be added and be actually unique... well, as unique as they are in the books. Regardless, the idea is to make this a mud where immortals aren't needed to facilitate player advancement, but players can advance to upper reaches themselves, with nothing more than an investment of time, relationships, and effort.</desc>

Now Commander Adama of the Battlestar Galatica and President Laura Roslin lead a ragtag fleet of refugees in a supposed search for the fabled lost thirteenth colony, Earth. However, the dangers they face are many which compound an already difficult situation. In addition to The Cylons hunting and attacking the fleet in space; their infiltrator units carry out a more subtle plot even as their former unwitting pawn, Gaius Baltar, helps in the hunt for them while hiding both his own guilt and the strange presence that haunts his every thought. If that wasn't enough, the fleet also faces internal political conflict of which the rabble rousing figure, Tom Zarek, is merely the loudest dissenting voice. In the midst of these trials however, clues begin to appear that suggest that Adama's simple bluff about Earth may be more truthful than anyone knowing could have guessed.</desc>

    <desc>The unique world of PowerMud has been around since May of 1997. The world is over 7000 rooms and is full of exotic and unique settings, monsters, and items.  There are no 'stock' areas on PowerMud, they are only found here and nowhere else. There are Twelve different races to choose from, as well as over Twenty Guilds that you character can join.  The types of Guilds range from Thieves, Mages, Clerics, Fighters, to other 'non-stock' guilds such as Assassins, Monks, Merchants, Cultists, and Illusionists.  Having multiple characters is allowed as well, so you can find a character that suits you best. PowerMud uses a customized Skill system, where experience is gained for a certain skill by actually performing that skill!  For instance, if your character can 'hide' in the shadows, practicing doing so will raise your skill level.  No more dividing up your experience points between non-related skills!  As for the different skill types, there is a high number of them, ranging from the normal combat skills (slash, blunt, pierce) to specialized skills such as 'Advanced Melee', 'Sailing', 'Mercantile', 'Fishing', and 'Mental Attack' (Psionics, which any Player could potentially possess). Once your character gains some well-deserved experience, you can then choose from over Forty Professions.  These Professions will augment your general Guild skills, or perhaps add new ones.  You could choose the Bard Profession, and learn how to play songs that boost skills while also gaining some needed thieving skills.  Or perhaps you would want to go to the 'builder' Professions, such as Chef, Blacksmith, Carpenter, Inditar (Scroll making), Alchemist, or Artificer.  Maybe you want to supplement your fighting skills, so you could go with Archer, Bladesman, Sapper, Duelist, Horseman, Blind-Fighter, or many others.  Since you can have more than one Profession, the unique combinations possible are only limited by your imagination. PowerMud has a non-PK killing zone called the Killing Fields, where Players can go to and battle each other without fear of losing a life. Every now and then Grand Melees are held, with the winners obtaining prizes consisting of free experience, money, and magical equipment. The Developers and Players on PowerMud are friendly and easy to get along with, and the Admins are almost always online to answer any questions that you may have.  If you log in and experience the unique atmosphere that is PowerMud, you will surely enjoy it.</desc>

    <desc>Sanity's Edge is a cyberpunk genre mud set in the decaying center of Edge City. Two sides of life are vividly depicted, the rich, opulent life of the corporations and the wretched squallor of the street. The year is 2032 and local politics have been effectively controlled by the corporations, led by the dominating Cybernetic Matrix Designs corporation. The glittering CMD building looms brightly at the center of downtown, but not far away the seedier aspects of life hide in run-down apartment buildings and shadowy alleyways.</desc>
    <desc>Street gangs stake out territory, and are always looking for more cannon fodder like you to join their ranks. Just remember, it's a war out there, and you never know when you might get caught in the crossfire.  Crime is on the rise, and netrunners are the wave of the future, becoming the backbone of the crime scene with their intimate knowledge of the Net.</desc>
    <desc>Safety has become a thing of the past; you may find yourself assaulted by a street kid with a switchblade or an irate shopowner with a sawed-off shotgun. With a little luck and some smarts, you might fight your way to the top -- even into a corporate job. And then you'll only have one thing to worry about, your CredCard -- never leave home without it.</desc>

    <desc>Avalon: The First Age is a return to a time when Avalon was savage and untamed and civilisation was just beginning to emerge from the depths of the dark ages. There are three major cityports - Mercinae: City of Justice and Honour and home to the Mage, Knights, Mystics, Bards and Alchemists guilds Thakria: The City of Miracles, home to the power-seekers and evil guild of Sorcerers, Seers, Loremasters and Thieves. Parrius: City of the Free, once a pirate stronghold, Parrius is now home to the Minstrels, Warriors, Enchanters and Artisans. Others guilds exist that are more independent; The Rangers of the Greenwood, the peace-loving Animists and the secretive Brigands. This land is a rich tapestry of adventure and role play with the ultimate aim of ordination for the select few who can stand the course. This is not a game for the faint of heart, but for those who would stand up and be counted as legends and leaders in their own lifetime. This is a land of unrestricted combat incorporating the now famous Avalon combat system in full; oft copied but never bettered.</desc>

    <desc>Deren Gard is a land in the midst of war between mortals and dragons. Cities have been burned to the ground, thousands of armies have been utterly destroyed. With a eery calm in the war, empires rebuild, and new heroes arise. Mortals must unite to destroy a common foe.</desc>
    <desc>This is a fantasy themed mud, roleplaying is definately encouraged but not neccesary. This is a fully playerkill mud, but there are protections and limits to allow a friendly environment. We are currently rebuilding alot of the stock areas, and looking for builders to help us. There aren't really any major theme plans right now, looking for players and immortals to help influence what it changes into.</desc>
    <desc>We are open for players right now, although expect many changes to come in the next few weeks. These changes shouldn't affect your gameplay too much, except to enhance it.</desc>

    <desc>Arion: the Nightmare is the second edition of original Arion which no  longer exists. The first version of Arion came out in 2004. Since that much has changed in a good way of course.  In Arion there are 5 sides: Blackies (Orc, Goblin, Demon, Troll), Whities (Elf, Dwarf, Human, Hobbit), Brownies (Nomad, Giant, Ssrathi, Formian), Misties (Ghost, Wight) and Fallens (Drow, Gollum, Fallen, Duergar). These sides can do pk with each other. The main goal of a player here is to advance in levels until he or she is great enough to slay enemy  heroes. Then the real fun begins.  Arion is an innovative player kill encouraged MUD. There are all capabilities for role play as it makes the environment more natural. We like realism, we hide no brutality. Arion's player kill highly supports one's mudding skill - there are a lot of different strategies how to bring your enemy down. Also, we like it if the game is convenient to play so that all the necessary programming is always done for the mudding here to be as easy as possible.  You can play Arion in IRONMAN mode - You will gain 2x exp but if you happen to die it will be permanent. If an ironman character becomes a hero (level 51) and it dies then it will become a Ghost/a Wight which is the only way to play these hidden races.  Finally, Arion will be an ultimate MUD where magic and realism work together mixed with humor and fun. We like it if the game allows the player to do things it can do in real life and it is our main condition in development. Secondly, we try to avoid making any rules and punishments because we believe that it is possible to make the system so good that the count of rules would be minimal.</desc>

    <desc>We have tried our best to make this the kind of mud that encourages just hanging out and helping others. Newbies are very welcome. There is nothing better than turning on a newbie to mudding. (IMHO)</desc>
    <desc>Check out our homepage to see what all you can do, what spells and skills you can gain, and if your interested you can even look to see who is playing right now and what levels they are.</desc>

    <desc>Rage of Vengeance is a playerkill mud, giving players the choice to either play good- or evil-aligned in the eternal struggle between good and evil.

    <desc>Bleached InuYasha Galaxy (previously known as InuYasha Galaxy) is a hybrid MUD that mixes together the Bleach and InuYasha anime series into one unique intense adventure.</desc>
    <desc>[We also have a pure PVP/PK port open on port 1804]</desc>
    <desc>Our average player count ranges from 5-20 players online. One of our most unique features is our shard system, where shards (shikon shards) of a jewel (the Shikon no Tama) have been scattered across both eras, thus players can find these shards and use them to increase their own power by embedding them into body parts as well as attaching them to items. This plays a very important role in our intense PK system as well. There is virtually no limit for the strength of a player, and we have absolutely no stock areas, classes, or races. Since players have full control over the clan system, clan wars become extremely bloody (and even more so with shikon shards in play).</desc>
    <desc>Here are just some of our features: -Embed shards of the Shikon no Tama in different body parts for various strengths, or attach shards to weapons and armor. -Combine enough shards and create the Shikon no Tama, which can grant your deepest desire! -Create your own customizable Youkai (demon) transformation. -Travel between two worlds; the Modern and Feudal era (time travel). -A unique class system, where you can multi-class into different classes such as Combatant or Slayer, and level up the class. -Set up your own shop and sell items with a merchant cart. -Create, customize, and control your own clans. -Plenty of skills right from both anime series, such as Sankon Tetsusou (Iron Reaver Soul Stealer), or Kidou (Demon Arts). -An elemental system (fire, wind, earth, etc), where players can choose an element on creation as well as elemental weapons. -Unique weapon attacks, where special weapons can fire powerful attacks. ...and so much more!</desc>

    <desc>On the first day, we created an account system to keep players more organized... And it was good.</desc>
    <desc>On the second day, we created a new kind of auction system, never seen before in MUDs... And it was good.</desc>
    <desc>On the third day, we created speedwalk and multi-commands... And it was good, but the players wanted more! So, on the fourth day, we created clans so that players could congregate.</desc>
    <desc>On the fifth day, we did away with PK... And the morts stopped killing each other.</desc>
    <desc>On the sixth day, we made the mobs come to life so the world was not so dreary and boring.</desc>
    <desc>On the seventh day, we thought players should have a lot of fun with Quests, so we created ways to let Immortals run quests a lot easier... And that was definitely good.</desc>

The Legends of Krynn offers a wide variety of races as well as classes, clans, skills, spells and various other options. Roleplay is encouraged and enforced. The date in which The Legends of Krynn takes place, is shortly after the War of the Lance (30 years after). Many unique systems not found anywhere else, such as our very unique Grouping system and our Clan system, reside here. Solamnic Knights govern the world as 'police', as they do in the books. There is NO Auto-Flagging for (Thief, Killer, Treason, Assault, Outlaw). Flagging of another player for a crime is controlled by members of the Solamnic Knights. Come check it out, but be warned, this MUD, while very newbie friendly, is still probably more for advanced MUDers, or people who have never played a MUD before and were never corrupted by all the Power MUDs out there. This is NOT a POWER MUD. No powerleveling here. Intelligence is requierd.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Ansalon,</desc>
    <desc>Ansalon is a Dragonlance MUD (Multi User Dungeon, Text Based Game) where a player can become an imaginary character in the DragonLance world, and interact with other players who are also playing at the same time. Your character can be a Silvanesti Elf, a Neidar Dwarf, a Human, a Minotaur, a fun-loving Kender, or any of a multitude of races.</desc>
    <desc>Ansalon has been up and running since 1996. It is a stable, well-developed world, with custom code and custom areas to explore. Even over a decade later, we're making upgrades and changes on a weekly basis!</desc>
    <desc>Ansalon is always looking for new players with new stories to tell and new conflicts to insight. Speaking of stories, check out our stories page!! Thousands of stories from 1999 through now! Read them by author, updated as they post!</desc>
    <desc>Newbies are encouraged and with them in mind, Ansalon offers detailed maps and lots of people willing to help out and give advice so that folks unused to Ansalon _don't_ have to struggle through the often painful process of learning a new MUD. There is a great 'USE' command for almost any object you find, give it a shot! Ask questions on the Newbie channel (or OOC), get all of the free maps from the school..

    <desc>7 Degrees of Freedom has now been in operation for over eight years, having just undergone a huge expansion involving 24 new quests and 4 new classes.  Equipment storage has been added, and large expansions to several other zones have been implemented.  Our quest and zone writers have added new material that gives the world a unique face and map.</desc>
    <desc>The game dynamically resets objects and mobiles in a way invisible to players. Once you have reach the level of Wizard you can become mortal again, and run more quests to try and reach the level of MasterWizard. Our quest information system assigns a combat and puzzle rating to each quest, to help you gear your challenge to your ability.</desc>
    <desc>As with most Abers, Roleplay is not encouraged and the main emphasis on the MUD is on everyone having a good time. The 7DOF ethos is that players should be permitted to enjoy their MUDing experience, hence we do not have niggling rules against quest recompletion, etc.</desc>
    <desc>We are open to our players' ideas and suggestions, and enjoy receiving submissions for new quests and zones.</desc>
    <desc>We also pride ourselves on not having tell-logging or snooping. Privacy is respected.</desc>

    <desc>Greetings!</desc>
    <desc>What you have here is a classic.  WileyMUD III is a cleaned up release of the mud that ran at WMU for several years back in 1992, and then again briefly in 1995.</desc>
    <desc>You will find a pretty well balanced game, using traditional AD&amp;D second edition rules.  You'll find multi-classing.  You'll find mobs that are somewhat more clever than usual.  You'll also find an entire world, all original, and over 3000 rooms in size.</desc>
    <desc>You won't find lots of flashy ANSI colours, nor will you find Ub3r-D3tH Swordz that do 9999 points of damage.  You won't find a cuddly mud school to wipe the noses of players who are used to being immortal inside of a week.</desc>
    <desc>I've had this game up and running for my own testing purposes for quite a while, and occasionally see someone drop by.  So, I figured why not see if anyone out there wants to actually play the game?</desc>
    <desc>You won't find any immortals on, but if people really do start playing, I might just see about getting a few to mind the store.</desc>

    <www>http://sites.google.com/site/secondsunmud/</www>
    <desc>Second Sun MUD is set on a gigantic, city-sized space station far from Earth.</desc>
    <desc>In orbit with a small planet circling the second star humanity has ever lived around, the station is an almost completely self-sufficient artificial ecosystem.  It was built from the three immense star ships the ancestors of the present inhabitants used to travel from Earth's solar system.  The ships were known as â€œgeneration shipsâ€ because they were designed to house many generations of people in order to facilitate a journey far longer than the human lifespan.  There are more than a million people currently living aboard.</desc>
    <desc>The station has been in complete isolation for the last three and a half centuries, not including the time it took for the ships to first arrive.  For unknown reasons, 40 years into the voyage, transmissions from the home system stopped completely and abruptly. Though many of the ships' passengers wanted to turn back around to find out what was wrong, it was ultimately decided that too much had already been invested.  The ships already had all the supplies and information they needed to complete the mission, and they could always await for word from the home world at their destination. Apart from the radio silence and four major, failed attempts at mutiny, the journey went as planned.</desc>
    <desc>Conditions aboard the station are varied, as they can be in any metropolis, and range from the squalid and derelict to the pristine. The conjoined hulls of the three star ships form the core of the station, which today makes up only about 40% of its total mass.  The rest has been built from materials mined from beneath the surface of the planet it is in orbit with.</desc>
    <desc>The de jure government aboard the station takes the form of a representative democracy, and anyone over the age of 20 who is of organic origination and has not been convicted of a felony can vote. While the original government retains tight control over portions of the station, many areas have managed to slip into the hands of unrecognized splinter governments; some parts of the station, particularly the oldest, have degenerated into various states of anarchy.</desc>

Our goal is to provide a fun, active game, especially for people who like the \"online tabletop\" style of play, and enjoy using dice, spending XP, and the like. We pattern ourselves after the topical materials of the genre, things like \"New Mutants\", \"Teen Titans\", \"Young Justice\" and the like.  So, there's tons of games out there on the internet...why choose us? We like to believe that the key to success for a game like this is actually having staff who are proactive staffers. So we'll be actively running plots and stories. We help make your character with you, so you've got a hand right from the start. We're not afraid to say \"no\" when needed to keep the game at the right feel and theme, and we're also not afraid to say \"get out\" to elements that might be disruptive. We hold to the basic philosophy that we're all here to have fun and tell a good story together.  We want: people who are willing to be active, to be part of a good story, and who are as willing to help their fellow players look awesome as they are to look awesome themselves. People who are willing to blend the fun and wonder and humor of teen superheroes with the more serious side of coming-of-age without falling into the twin perils of angst or special-snowflakism.</desc>

It is also the beginning of something new, taking the 40+ races, 11 classes (with 9 variations of mage plus a choice of wild magic or not and each deity's cleric is specialized) and going further.</desc>
    <desc>The world is limited to one continent now, Matierra but it is no small place easilly over 10,000 rooms. Expansions will be ongoing, including another continent and other areas on at least one other world itself. There are currently 6 hometowns, each with its own design and some specialized for certain races.</desc>
    <desc>Splintered Realms welcomes the casual player as well as the avid roleplayer, though it is expected that everyone will put some effort to their character, a description, filling out a profile which can be detailed or just a facts sheet.</desc>
    <desc>Also, one of the nice features to this codebase is that the player first logs in with an email address. Once this is done they may make new characters under that email and need never remember more then their one account password. The command 'skinslip' allows a player to change between characters without logging off.</desc>

Well over 150 wizards have contributed to the more than sixty different areas that are open for exploration by players.  There are several unique aspects of Realmsmud, including the multi- character system, a volunteer militia, an extensive player run nobles system where players may band together to create and defend their house against seiges from rival houses, and finally a trade skills system. Trades include Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Cartography, Fletching, Jewelcraft, Leathercraft, and Tailoring.  Players have the option of creating their own fortress with rooms and monsters.  So, feel free to drop in on us.  New players will enter the game at Central Park (CP) after going through the brief character creation process.  To help new players get acclimated to Realmsmud, they are given a chat line to ask questions on.  Volunteer players above level 15, called newbie helpers, are online to answer any questions that a player might have about the mud.</desc>

    <desc>Once, long ago, while I wandered between worlds, I heard whisper of an ancient conflict. Old hatreds between peoples; long ago enemies from across the sea. thirteen years ago, the first gossip came to me, that on this one world, a 'new' Continent was discovered. How they were gravely mistaken: instead of prosperous fields and lands to be conquered, the followers of Bosco rediscovered the people of Selina. For a time, they attempted to live in peace, however their differences were too great, and the rumbles of war could be heard once again.</desc>
    <desc>As I continued to drift in the sea of dimensions, I was drawn to this world. I heard that one could be reborn as a new race there, or continue ones studies to new levels of specialization. There were four, then five, now four again factions to be found there, fighting amongst themselves for control. Did they not see the bigger picture? Perhaps, only from the outside, could I hear the winds of change. This land held much promise, and I had much to atone for. Perhaps here, I could finally be redeemed for my sins. As you read this, fellow traveller, I have departed for this world. I believe it to be the place of my salvation... and perhaps yours too. Will you join me and seek REDEMPTION?</desc>
    <desc>Redemption has an extremely well developed pkill system. The great majority of Redemption's 14 year history has involved balancing and adding to our pkill system, while maintaining an enjoyable option for those who do not wish to pkill.</desc>
    <desc>Redemption is constantly updating and improving, with 3.5 active coders.  Most recently, a hardcore pkill system (full loot is back), a new class, metallic dragon colours, and player-controllable areas were added.</desc>
    <desc>As Redemption has 10 races (many with racial-variations such as dragon colours or sliver types), each with 2 sub-races, and 13 classes, each with 2 sub-classes, you will spend countless hours trying new combinations.  Redemption is well known for having a close relationship between the coders and the mortals, meaning all changes are carefully debated and vetted before implementation.</desc>

Our guilds are heavily researched and we use real life inspirations for their backgrounds.  The Templar guild is really based on the Templars (from the titles, to the starting equipment). Psionicists are based on the actual principles of Chakras.  Druids are true to their Celtic roots rather than a bunch of eco-terrorists!  Not enough?  We've got over 60 races, over 20 classes, hundreds of unique skills and spells, quests tailored to guilds, explosive events, castles -- you name it, we've got it.  And if we don't have it, we're working on it. It's six MUDs in one.  Come by and check us out. You'll be glad you did!</desc>

    <desc>Change is in the air at Match of the Millennium. Ancient evil stirs, masterful fighters struggle with one another in a power play that stretches generations. Come experience one of the deepest combat experiences available in a setting rich with kung fu lore, a chance to create new adventures with timeless characters. MotM draws its characters and theme inspiration from classic fighting series like King of Fighters, Street Fighter, and Fatal Fury. Players have an opportunity to step into the shoes of classic fighting game characters and expand their stories, or craft their own would-be fighting legends.</desc>
    <desc>It's No Sin to Be Mighty: Match of the Millennium boasts the most balanced, nuanced, and diverse combat system of any game of its kind, and players are encouraged to master its intricacies. Some have said that we are two games in one -- being both cooperative role-playing endeavor and competitive turn-based battle of wits -- and indeed, the original vision for our combat system was one that, like a fighting game, could be pushed to its limits by canny players without ever allowing exploitation while balancing the system. We are very proud of the result: one that, like all great games, allows complex possibilities to arise from simple fundamentals. But crucial to the success of this approach is our culture, of which we are equally proud: one that firmly values role-playing over character power or player skill. Fundamentally, characters compete, but players cooperate -- to create a story that all can enjoy. Remember, it's no sin to be mighty at Match of the Millennium, but here, true victories are always shared.</desc>
    <desc>New Challengers Welcome: Jump right in to the action with our new streamlined application process, or design your own character and freely choose the level of power and experience you wish your creation to begin at. Our new and innovative approach distinguishes between Supporting and Core Feature Characters, separating them not by power or popularity but by the amount of background knowledge required to adequately role-play them, thereby allowing new players unfamiliar with the theme to still start at whatever skill level they find most interesting and learn about the world as they go. Many fighting game characters can be sufficiently summarized with a paragraph and their unique look or style; precisely part of the appeal of a game like Match of the Millennium is fully realizing a living character from a cool or memorable template. It is our hope and ambition that all players do just that over the course of play -- but not our expectation that they have done so before they begin. At Match of the Millennium we offer several hundred of these characters already statted for play, many easy to make your own.</desc>
    <desc>Read more at http://motm.kicks-ass.net or connect at telnet://motm.kicks-ass.net:2002 and expand the epic tale of your favorite character, or craft your own warrior on the path to enlightenment... or destruction.</desc>

    <desc>Time of Troubles is a Rom/Sunder/Rot mud with many additions. Theme is basic medieval with an AD&amp;D Forgotten Realms influence and feel. We strive for class diversity while retaining balance. Our immortal staff is extremely dedicated, and we boast a near completely original world which is still growing daily. The players on Time of Troubles are extremely helpful and full of ideas, which us implementor/coders take into full consideration and most often find a way of working into the code in a balanced manner. We boast three competent coders, two of which are owners of the mud. We never have problems with coders not doing things here, and will be expanding as rapidly as players permit. Time of Troubles is a pk optional mud, with many things for nonpk players, while maintaining an intense pk environment. Our roleplaying is ran by a team of professional staff members and encourages everyone to join in and help shape the world of Time of Troubles.  A VERY brief overview of some of our features: (to see more, read \"help changes\" when you log onto the mud).</desc>
    <desc>***34 selectable player races. ***9 selectable player classes: Warrior, Mage, Thief, Cleric, Ranger, Monk, Chaosmage, Elementalist, Archer. We also have 3 new classes currently in heavy development. ***An extremely user friendly built in map and configurable mini-move-map system for easy navigation. ***Over 500 new skills and spells added, along with all the classics being rebalanced and reworked for the class system. ***Numerous new functions and features too abundant to name. Encumberance, Chaotic spell effects, a D&amp;D style feat system, player ran clans with wars, etc. We will never stop advancing.</desc>
    <desc>Time of Troubles is a stable mud with a staff that logs on daily and makes changes, but most importantly listens to players.  Time of Troubles will continue to grow and change based around the players while still retaining balance. Come join the Troubles.  We hope to see you soon.</desc>

    <port>4242</port>
    <www>http://www.everwar.net</www>
    <desc>Everwar is up and running full tilt!  Everwar is a full-featured, expansive player-vs-player MUD. The basic concept is a titanic struggle between good and evil - player killing is not only expected, but encouraged! Evolving out of and deriving ideas from the popular EmlenMUD Rites of Passage, Everwar has been open for close to 7 years in various states. It features a total of 23 races (11 balanced per side, as well as humans which are playable on either alignment) and more than 200 skills and spells.</desc>
    <desc>Everwar allows for highly customized character design, using a 'remort' based system. This system will allow you to restart your level at 1, but with greatly enhanced abilities every time you choose to remort. Upon remort, you can choose to spend your accumulated 'remort points' in one of more than 25 different statistics, customizing your character to your specific playstyle.  There is an extensive quest and crusade system, providing both exhaustive solo and challenging group combat. The quest/crusade system allows a player to explore the map, either individually or in crusade groups. Target mobiles (creatures, or 'mobs') are located in different far-flung areas, which encourages discovery and adventure.  Through this system the player not only encounters the map and other players, but is also rewarded with quest points. These points can be spent in a variety of ways.</desc>
    <desc>Another major feature Everwar offers over other MUD's is an integrated overhead mapping feature. With such an enormous map, this is a vital tool for players to utilize whether new or experienced. This feature also allows new players to quickly learn how to find their way around the world.</desc>
    <desc>The most exhilarating feature of Everwar is the player vs. player combat. Set in a mythic game world, the armies of light and the forces of darkness are pitted against each other in eternal war. Good and evil players cannot communicate, which adds a significant amount of challenge to the field of battle a virtual 'fog of war'. Intelligence is gathered by scouting and reconnoitering the enemy, and when your foes are most vulnerable, the battle is joined! Fighting and chasing occurs over more than 23,000 in-game rooms.</desc>
    <desc>With your enemies vanquished, the spoils of war are yours in the form of their equipment, as well as 'warpoints', which serve to increase your standing within your chosen profession. 13 professions are currently in-game. With choices ranging from the secretive assassin masters of poison and deceit, to the classic warrior, with their formidable armor and weapons, you choose how you want to fight!</desc>

    <desc>Video intro can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urK3BLju60</desc>
    <desc>In the doom and despair of post-Cataclysm Krynn, fear and destruction reign supreme. Plague and famine cloak the world in a shroud of death, disease and decay. The innocent have been judged as harshly as the wicked and in the so-called absence of the Gods, the Seekers look to further themselves by claiming theirs is the only way to true Faith.</desc>
    <desc>The once protectors of the innocent the Knights of Solamnia, live in fear of persecution. The ignorant lay the blame of the Cataclysm upon the shoulders of those once mighty knights while unbeknownst to them, Takhisis is already preparing her forces.</desc>
    <desc>Of late, however, Takhisis' gateway to this world has been rendered useless by a man named Berem. He dislodged a piece of the Foundation Stone, thus making it incomplete. Rumour has it, that the piece of the Foundation Stone he stole, has embedded itself in his chest. Should Takhisis find Berem, his life will be forfeit and the Gateway restored, giving the Dragon Queen full access to Krynn and an army to follow her.</desc>
    <desc>It remains to be seen if the evil minions of Takhisis will overcome the world as it recovers from the Cataclysm. Will you become a hero who fights the darkness threatening to invade this world or will you attempt to snuff out the light for all times...</desc>
    <desc>--------------------------------------------------------------------</desc>
    <desc>Krynn's Peak is back online. After some years of dormancy the coders decided to bring back up this old and joyful DragonLance mud. The mud is focused on roleplay and takes pride in being true to the DragonLance novels.</desc>
    <desc>The code is based on Rom2.4 but has gone through so many changes that listing them all would be impossible. Some of the features include:</desc>
    <desc>* Redone fight system. You now actually have to be active in the fights to come out successfully. * Greatly modified spell system. * New prayer system for clerics and paladins. * Overworld map identical to the world of Krynn. Consisting of over 16000 rooms. * New weather system. * Many new skills, races, abilities, classes. * All the guilds and clans featured in the novels. * New quest code. Quests are made by hand by the builders guaranteeing for interesting and challenging quests. * Much much more.</desc>
    <desc>Be aware though that we are still making some major changes to the game mechanics, thus we haven't officially openend the mud for the public yet. The game is fully playable though and highly entertaining.</desc>

    <desc>Dadi del Destino è il frutto di un lunghissimo lavoro. Allo stato attuale il mud è ancora in beta in quanto mancante di alcune parti, ma completo al 95%. Il gioco è aperto e disponibile da diversi mesi; per chiunque voglia provarlo raccomando di vedere bene il sito web in quanto molte meccaniche sono differenti da quelle usuali. I personaggi, durante il passaggio da beta a release, non saranno cancellati, quindi chiunque giochi al momento potrà conservare il proprio personaggio.</desc>
    <desc>Caratteristiche principali: Sistema di skill innovativo in cui ogni classe ha accesso a tutte le skill, ma il potenziale di utilizzo di una skill varia a seconda della classe. Il personaggio può essere caratterizzato e particolare; si può scegliere se puntare molto su certe skill oppure fare un po’ di tutto ma poco bene. Due tipologie di magie, arcana e divina. Quattro vie che determinano l’impostazione base della classe del personaggio, via dell’ombra, via dello spirito, via della forza e via dell’arcano. Per ogni via sono disponibili alcune classi che determinano in modo più specifico le capacità del personaggio. Livelli virtualmente illimitati. Tre grandi tipologie di oggetti, enhanced, godforged e crafted. I primi creati tramite l’utilizzo della magia e sono gli oggetti che generalmente vengono utilizzati, i secondi creati dagli dei e gli utimi prodotti da fabbri, armaioli, sarti ecc... Tipi di materiali differenti che determinano la struttura e la resitenza dell’oggetto, speciali protezioni sulle armature e speciali attacchi sulle armi. Numerose quest fisse per ogni livello, in continuo aumento. Sistema di reward point con cui si premia chi impegna il tempo per far crescere il gioco, trovando bug o creado aree o semplicemente segnalando i typo. Tramite i punti reward è possibile comprare ed editare oggetti speciali superiori a quelli trovabili in gioco, questo per compensare l’impegno di tempo. Player killing e player steling non bloccato ma gestito tramite punti wanted, i punti wanted vengono presi quando si ruba un oggetto o si uccide un giocatore, questo viene esteso anche a certi npc come i negozianti, le guardie o alcuni speciali. Chi riceve la flag killer o thief può subire l’aggressione da parte degli altri pg liberamente. Inoltre ci sono speciali mob, i bounty hunter, che vanno a caccia dei pg con la flag. Possibilità di acquistare, costruire o affittare una casa, in cui mettere i propri possedimenti. Gestione avanzata delle armi con dimensioni differenti, tipo di impugnatura, parti di armatura che possono essere usati come armi con gli attacchi speciali, esempio l’elmo per una testata o i guanti per un pugno. Riduzione del danno per le armature e capacità di penetrazione per le armi. Molto altro ancora, già implementato o di prossima implemetazione che non sto qui ad elencare per questioni di spazio.</desc>
    <desc>Vi aspetto, e soprattutto se avete aree già pronte o volete fare un area ma non sapete come fare, è disponibile un potente editor in grado di caricare aree scritte per circle (con alcune varianti), merc e smaug.</desc>

    <desc>DARBONNE, THE FLOATING CITY</desc>
    <desc>There was a time, long before the beginning of history, when there were both good and evil forces in the Land of Mordor.  The battles between them raged constantly with first one side and then the other claiming victory.  It was during the third age, at a time when the dragons and balrogs had joined forces against the elves, dwarves and humans in a grand assualt against them that a triad of powerful wizards and a white mage saved the city of Darbonne by casting a self-perpetuating spell on it.  The spell lifted the city into the air, higher than any dragon could fly.  Unfortunately, one of Darbonne's great libraries was torn asunder and parchments which were stored there, upon which were recorded offensive spells from the realms of Earth, Wind, Fire and Water, were lost from that library.  Mighty adventurers still seek the fragments of those mystical parchments in many dangerous and mysterious places.</desc>

Well this is it, holomud is the result of time, being a very old mud with an old admin group, yet new and exciting to the new players.  We feature a holodeck ran system that allows the player to run simulations.  No food/drink/renting costs, and even the newest of players stands a chance in the game.  Gold is no longer an issue, holomud runs on a credit system that acts like gold/exp combined, but credits can't be given away.  It is much more interesting that even I can explain. Just give it a try.</desc>

    <desc>Dragonfire is an ancient LPmud that has evolved for many years. Recently spun-off (hence the II), the mud is being worked on intensively, incorporating new features and updating the code. Dragonfire is a unique experience in the mud world, as it has not necessary followed the traditional paths of MUD evolution. Many of our loyal player base have been around for seven or eight YEARS, following the MUD through its trial and tribulations--new hosts, new admin, hacker attacks, and so forth. Dragonfire has a strong focus on player- killing, but PK is by each player's choice--the best of both worlds. The 'guilds' of Dragonfire are classes, skills, spells, and clans all wrapped into one in a style that makes Dragonfire unique. Come by and check us out!</desc>

    <desc>ShadowGate is a huge MUD that sticks closely to the AD&amp;D manuals. We strive to form a community of adventurers with all aspects of interactions, both positive and negative. Look forward to prejudice and tolerance, conflict and cooperation, hate and love.</desc>
    <desc>Our systems of multi-classing, races, weapon and non-weapon proficiencies, languages, spells, deities, and required introductions all make you feel as if the world of ShadowGate is an evolving environment.  Indeed characters can eventually gain influence and control over parts of the world as \"High Mortals\", continuing to shape and grow the game further.</desc>
    <desc>We insist that you roleplay.  Roleplaying is a process, not an end goal.  Each individual thread of your character's experiences, misadventures, friends and enemies becomes the tapestry of his or her life, and the whole winds up becoming more than it's parts. We strictly enforce this as best as we are capable. We encourage RP through a system of Avatars, which are our DM's. They are not creators or builders. They are people who drive interactive quests through various abilities and interactively controlled NPCs.  Avatars and creators are all selected from the players who have played and gained our trust, to ensure consistancy with the game's evolution forward.</desc>
    <desc>The ultimate, and perhaps idealistic, goal is to make the ShadowGate world reflect not only the tabletop world of adventure and RP, but also those idle times of characters - the times in the city, spending your gold, reflecting on your adventures. We encourage any player who wishes to become part of the community to join us, enjoy what we have, and help us make it better and move toward our goal.</desc>

    <desc>The MUD is in its 2nd year of heavy code modifications and area creation. We have only 2 simple rules to follow, and a huge number of skills/spells, as the primary theme of the MUD is simple: Make the players as powerful as they can possibly be, while increasing the difficulty of the game to adapt to your increase in power, which quickly eliminates boredom.</desc>
    <desc>The game, which is fantasy-based, is pure PK, and all of our players are always more than willing to help out new ones.  This includes Immortals, who are prohibited from being lofty, invisible creatures whose sole purpose is to harass players and prevent them from having fun.  Players can remort once into another class, with both classes consisting of 100 levels, and once into the powerful Hero class.  You can watch players battle it out in an arena, as though you were walking along right beside them.  Battles will be legendary in their magnitude, consisting of entire towns (and players if they wish to join) destroying each other, some for the pursuit of power and wealth, some just to watch the other side perish.

After six long years the world united as one and what was once pain and suffering rapidly became entertainment. Without national barriers and even no language barriers entertainment became a large focus while other research went bankrupt due to lack of funding. Come the year 2040 Internet gaming was the top grossing form of entertainment and any company that hoped to earned money was in on the business. One research company known as Faust &amp; Solomon Enterprises decided to corner the market with a new development. They created a new gaming system and game. They packaged it as one with one name Hirladan. That was the name of this believed virtual world, though in truth it was part of a research test. Using mental images and skills a person knew to create a sprite to exist in another world. While these sprites that uses amplified and modified skills such as a creative writer being a good spell caster, they also knew they could test resurrection and even duplication because ‘NPCs’ must be killed. A wizard to the north found these seemingly undying sprites, while struck down they rose again so to further his plots to take the struggling world he must stop the influx of immortals. A spell was developed and for two years people have been disappearing in the real world and hybrids of the character they were and who the look like have been showing up in game un able to log out as the spell merges body and mind into Hirladan.</desc>
    <desc>It is possible for very unique creation as one can range from players to natives and even the trapped playes if one chosese to do so. So please stop in and give it a look see.</desc>

We attempt to recreate, with as much authenticity as possible, the atmosphere and society described in the books. Set in the Southern Continent of Pern we are set in the 10th Pass, one pass after the events in Dragonflight, The White Dragon etc. We do not recognize the events outlined in 'All the Weyrs of Pern', and therefore Thread still falls, though technology remainsl very limited.  SouCon MUSH is PernMUSH's sister game, and an ideal place to send a PC relative of a character you have here: we're running on the exact same timeline! Smaller than PernMUSH, SouCon offers a more intimate atmosphere for RP.  Currently, we have 2 Weyrs (mountainous Honshu and jungle-covered Southern), 2 Holds, and many Crafts, offering characters many ways in which to get involved.  We have 4 Hatchings a year, and Impress up to 10 players at each Hatching on average.  We consider ourselves one of the friendliest MUSHes out there, and offer help to new players of all levels of experience. Please join us at: soucon.silvertree.org: 4201 (63.199.182.123: 4201), and feel free to contact any of the Wizards or Guides (+rwho wiz and +rwho gui) for help!</desc>

    <desc>Multi-User Dungeon, or MUD for short, was the first ever game of this genre. For many years, MUD, or British Legends as it was known to players, existed on the CompuServe Information Service. In the fall of 1999, however, CIS decided to terminate British Legends as part of their Y2K cleanup efforts. Many players thought that this meant the end of their beloved game.</desc>
    <desc>That is not so. The present incarnation is a high-fidelity port of the original MUD code base to a modern server platform. This accurate reimplementation faithfully reproduces almost all the original's features, even some of the bugs that have become part of the game's lore.</desc>

    <desc>This version of MUD/BL was written with the permission of the original copyright holder by Viktor T. Toth (aka Viktor the arch-wizard, formerly MrSpock the wizard) in a 'mad programming binge' (as MUD's original author, Richard Bartle called it) in December 1999, and has been in limited operation on a test site since.

    <desc>The most ancient of elves speak of a time long ago when there were no humans walking the lands we know of today.  Nature and magic had reached a balance in this time of legend until the day the elves call 'Esz'tinia', or The Great Storm.  During The Great Storm an elf mage called Alkyone found solace for many beneath the waves where an heretofore unknown deity took pity on them and gave them a new life in the deep sea.  The Great Storm, which consisted not of rain and wind but fire and lightning raged over the world for many years.  The mighty dwarves from the hills and mountains had taken safety along with their gnome brethren in the deepest of their mines.</desc>
    <desc>When The Great Storm subsided those long years later and the races of the world crawled back onto the surface they found many changes. Men had begun to arrive, having fled lands now buried beneath unknown waters. What followed then were minor battles as man, elf, dwarf, and gnome redrew the boundaries of old.</desc>
    <desc>Then came the dragons.  Tiny pockets of hell cruising through the skies. Mostly humans roam the surface now, brought together into small pockets of life far from any dragon's lair.  The men unite under one deity with warriors and templars serving as defenders of the people.  Others seek to restore balance with the elements, others feed upon the chaos, and others create it as they wield magics never before seen upon the world.</desc>

    <desc>We have recently decided to restart SlothMUD after a solid 13 year run(out of 17). This means you can compete for levels, from the beginning of the game, and not worry about a top heavy who list.</desc>
    <desc>For 17 years, SlothMUD  has been one of the most successful MUDs of its kind. Sloth is a heavily modified Diku which offers a unique world of more than 24,000 rooms, inhabited by 8,500 people and creatures.  In SlothMUD , each player advances in all eight classes which are bard, cleric, druid, mage, monk, necromancer, thief, and warrior. In addition to the skills and spells of their classo, our multi-class system provides special powers to each \"prime\" class. As a result, the 1,680 possible class orderings have distinct play styles. Once a player reaches maximum level in all eight classes, a prestigious Avatar class opens up which gives him entirely new skills and powers.  Sloth provides its immortals with a unique scripting language, allowing them to build areas that are interactive to an unprecedented degree. These areas include complex puzzles, hundreds of scripted quests, and monsters that behave in surprising and intelligent ways.  Several areas provide more than simple hunt-and-kill; these include a PvP arena and a coliseum where the player can test his mettle against an ever-nastier series of monsters. For more information on this language, please visit http://www.outgribe.com/jason/mudl/index.html  We have added MXP(Mud Extension Protocol), MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol), an astrological event system,tons of new spells and skills, and much, much more. We have a one of best coding staffs around who enjoy adding player suggestions, as well as implementing many of their own ideas while maintaining our 'Slothy' feel.</desc>
    <desc>As well, one of our creators, William Lees, has been busy updating his MUD client Wintin.Net(an updated version of wintin95 which he also authored). It possesses many of the features we have added lately such as MXP, MCCP, etc. For more information on this great windows client,please refer to www.wintin.org</desc>
    <desc>A new web page was revealed recently which we believe is one of the best on the internet combining stunning graphics with Sloth related information. A live information section contains everything from a dynamic world map(which allows our players to watch each other move around our five continents) to player stats, live who lists, etc.</desc>
    <desc>SlothMUD also offers a very active immortal and administrative staff, constantly working to provide new and interesting experiences to challenge players. We are one of the most newbie-friendly MUDs around, with many experienced players willing to assist you in learning and enjoying our game. We look forward to seeing you soon!</desc>

    <desc>SMiLE is an abermud which supports player killing.  The object of the game is to obtain 30+ quest points and get 200,000 points to make wizard.  Points can be gained by solving puzzles and quests, killing mobiles and other players (if you have the killer flag) and dropping items of value in one of the two sacrificial pits.</desc>
    <desc>The type of character you play is your choice. You may choose to run a killer, play nice and merely defend yourself when attacked, or something in between.  Playing the mud as a player killing mud will increase the challenge you experience while running.  Player killing also gives you the opportunity to try to outwit human players who are less predictable than computer generated mobiles. You also have the choice of playing the mud as a nonplayer killing mud.  Which ever style you choose to play, the mobiles of SMiLE are more challenging than in some other muds.  The game has a complete combat system with weapons, armor and spells.  Weapons and armor are abundant and with a bit of exploration you can increase your magical knowledge.</desc>

    <desc>The streets of London are a dark place, even when the sun is out. The smog of the factories creates a haze over the Thames, and the rain smells of sulfur and coal. When night falls, the air becomes choked with the flavor of burned gas from the few lanterns that light the way along the major routes through the city. In this setting, thieves and fops mix and mingle, and the knowing and unknowing agents of the Gentry run their machinations to trap the unwary.</desc>
    <desc>The Winter King is dead. The Spring Queen is insane. The Summer Court is untested. The Autumn Lord schemes to take over the Seasonal Court, which has never been as disorganized as it is now. While some Changelings work to strengthen the Court, others go their own way, deserting the single cause that has kept them safe all of these years. Meanwhile, humanity grows; the prey for the Gentry gets more complacent and sedentary, making the city of London prime hunting grounds for the predators from beyond the Hedge.</desc>
    <desc>Victorian Reverie is a new World of Darkness game set in the Victorian Era of London. Our inspiration comes from Victorian literature and fantasy movies based in the period, with a slightly darker twist to things. We have code support for changelings (as per Changeling: The Lost) and normal mortals. We, at current, have no plans to expand the scope of the game.</desc>

    <desc>Spheres is a role playing environment very loosely related to Jack L. Chalker's Well World series.  Essentially the game world consists of an infinite plane of spheres, and  within each sphere is a snapshot of a different realm.</desc>
    <desc>For example, there is a sphere in which gryphons rule over their medieval jungles, and another in which centaurs are making the dangerous traversal from the nuclear age to the information age.  Focus is made upon the interaction of travelers migrating across different, foreign spheres. Players are encouraged to develop their own tinyplots, or even conceive and design their own spheres to add on to the game.  This is a solidly in character environment; if your looking for a place to hack and bash, or be all-powerful this isn't the game for you.  There is no combat system, and no plans to ever develop one.</desc>
    <desc>We consider ourselves very newbie friendly, and are willing to spend the time to help familiarize people with our theme.  All that is necessary to play in the game is to have read the news files pertaining to our theme 'news theme' and the info files regarding your species.  (Type 'info'.) If your interested in serious, exciting role play then come on out and welcome!  Others should apply elsewhere. :&gt;</desc>

Though there is no set time-period for this mud, the areas roughly follow the timeline around the original trilogy +7-10 years in the expanded universe. SWMUD consists of around 40 large planets and space stations, including Kashyyyk, Korriban, Myrkr, and Ryloth, as well as more well-known planets like Endor, Hoth, Tatooine, Naboo, and the Death Star.</desc>
    <desc>We have 10 guilds: assassin, bounty hunter, diplomat, jedi, mercenary, merchant, pilot, scientist, slicer, and smuggler. Each guild comes with an average of 30 unique skills. Player can choose three guilds for their character, with the option of taking a fourth guild at higher levels. Assassin and BH are forced-PK guilds, and Diplomats are forced non-PK.  There are 22 player-races, among them Bothan, Clawdite, Falleen, Wookiee, and Zabrak. Each race comes with two unique race skills and bonuses.  We have movable vehicles, ranged combat and an extensive space combat system. You can also build your own ship that is stored safely when you are not playing.  The mud has newsgroups for the players to post ideas and discuss various things about the mud. Quests are not required for advancement, though a few will significantly help in advancement. Help files are very extensive and are all available on the website. A special newbie simulator exists with several areas to help new players get started.

Tolkeen is a frontier kingdom, a haven for those who would be persecuted elsewhere for their differences. The city-state is itself one link in a short chain of alliances, their goal - survival against the many enemies at the doorstep: the Coalition (a human supremacist, military organization); predatory dimensional beings (D-Bees); supernatural entities whose thoughts and purposes are too alien to comprehend; as well, humanity's own personal demons, living amongst and within - ignorance, power-lust, and vice.</desc>
    <desc>The PCs of RfC live in a dangerous and mysterious world. Tolkeen's own secrets, of her origin and her survival, are yet to be discovered. Should you choose to take part, your impact upon this enduring quest will enrich the story today, and the story still untold.</desc>
    <desc>The kingdom has been built to allow extensive travel outside the main city, offering many varied environments for storytelling. This MUSH is ideal for self-motivated writers with good attitudes and keen wits.</desc>

You have the ability to create a unique character by choosing from: 19 unique races, a primary-, secondary-, tertiary-, and specialized pilot-class to create your very own specialized experience.</desc>
    <desc>You will bond with Mace Windu as he comes to your aid, and fear Boba Fett if you warrant him tracking you down in his sleek new Slave II in any of the well-beyond 100 zones that make up Revenge of the Jedi! Don't go to Dathomir alone, unless you're feeling lucky. You might lose more than just your hand. If you forget the hyperspace coordinates to Tatooine, I hope you remembered a comlink, or have a working nav-computer.

    <desc>Since the theme of Cruel and Lost World of Stonia is the struggle of good against evil, playerkilling is the backbone of this mud. There is a trohpy list and ranking system to see most powerful players. Monthly statistics of killings are also provided. Our world is Cruel and Lost, so you must take care of yourself.</desc>
    <desc>Although Stonia do not have extended class selection, we have many skills and spells depending on your class. You can compose character to your taste by choosing spells and skills. It is also possible to unlearn skills/spells and buy extra practise points.</desc>
    <desc>To make levelling and gathering of equipment more interesting there are many quests built into the mud and often immortals make live quests which is good way to get great fight and good equipment.</desc>
    <desc>We also have Deity points. Deity points are received via sacrificing enemy corpses, good equipment or special DP items to your God. Eventually your God may reward you if you have collected enough deity points.</desc>
    <desc>Levelling will be pretty fast once you get the hang of it. There is 50 normal levels which can be gained and lost by getting or losing experience points. If you advance to Hero level (51), you no longer have to fear about losing levels and you can concentrate on PK. If you are especially good at killing and collect enough War Points, you will become Warlord (level 53) or Avatar (level 55).</desc>
    <desc>Stonia is newbie friendly: we have HINT system to help new players and immortals will always help new players if 'prayed' for help.</desc>
    <desc>Stonia is constantly developing: we have active area-builders, code-masters and questmasters. The lethargy is over and the second wind is blowing :)</desc>

    <desc>StrangeMUD is a dynamic, growing mud that's been up for approximately two years now, and is constantly adding players, areas, skills, and nifty new code.  Our theme is 'Anything Goes'.  We're wacky and zany, and have the mobs to prove it - from Elvira, who gets _really_ peeved if you pinch her tush, to Bill Clinton, who wanders around town cleaning up the Whitewater affair.  Most, if not all of our areas have 'interesting' mobs - that is, those who don't just sit there while you kill them.  Mob progs and spec procs were added to tons and tons of mobs to make playing here a more remarkable experience than it already is.</desc>
    <desc>It should be pretty clear that we're proud of our mud, with good reason. Years of work have gone into it, and it's a damn fine mud, with great gods and players.</desc>

Players can build castles where they can store equipment. The castles are fully customizable, allowing custom descriptions, and guards, traps, doors and other items. Examples of guilds players can join are fighters, berserkers, priests, magicians, sorcerers, necromancers, abjurers and so on.</desc>

    <desc>In a world different from our own, there are peoples with the ability control the four elements. Earth. Water, Fire and Air. These people are known as benders. They formed into four different nations. The proud Fire Nation, on their large Island. The adoptive Northern and Southern Water tribes that inhabit the cold icy poles. The stout Earth Kingdom and their imminence continent. The un-materialistic Air Nomads and their isolated temples of the world.  And of all these nations, there is one person who can control all the elements; The Avatar who tries to bring balance to the world.</desc>
    <desc>Like all worlds there is strife, and a man named Kazuki, a powerful skilled Earthbender has created a Fifth Nation, the New Kingdom during a time when the Fire and Earth nations were gearing for war. He took advantage of the turmoil under the banner of world peace. He gathered the support of EarthBenders and riled the Northern Tribes under him due to piracy promoted by Earth and Fire nations.</desc>
    <desc>He took to the other nations with unceasing violence. He wrought the Northern Tribe to their knees, he scorched the vast continent of the Earth Kingdom and he razed the temples of the Air nomads.</desc>
    <desc>Now the world is beaten and the horizon is bleak as everyone makes their way to the final standing country; The Fire Nation, as refugees.</desc>
    <desc>Will you help take back these lands or will you join in arms for  world peace?</desc>

    <codebase>[Custom] Requires custom Java client</codebase>
    <www>http://hexehyl.snt.utwente.nl/starlane/</www>
    <desc>Starlane is an abstract, multi-player, network, real-time, persistent-world strategy game of intersteller empire-building and diplomacy. Starlane players take on the role of leaders of a galactic power group, issuing commands to units such as starships, bases and armies in order to achive their chosen goals; be they survial, prosperity or galactic domination.</desc>
    <desc>While player's orders are processed in real time and take effect immediately, Starlane was designed to be played over an extended period of time, with negotiations between players occuring through e-mail. The ideal Starlane game would involve tens (or hundreds) of players, thousands of star systems, and the kind of Byzantine diplomacy that would make Kofi Annan want to curl up and die.</desc>

    <desc>Entering its 12th year of existence, ThunderDome can now boast of being one of the longest running MUDs in the history of the internet.  In those years, ThunderDome has done much to advance the quality of game play, while adding much to the notions of what a diku-style mud should be. Tdome offers a dark, and at times, humorous perspective on a futuristic world set sometime after the earth's destruction. Human society,  formed mostly of roughly governed gangs, must now contend with aliens and mutated beasts for control of tdome's 13k rooms. Toward that end, players can choose between 13 different classes, and are allowed to log 3 of these characters on at once.</desc>
    <desc>Guns (dozens are offered) and magic vie for superiority in the tdome world, while biological implants and learned skills offer additional methods by which a character might improve his lot in a life filled to the brim with danger and adventure. Inexperienced players soon learn that the inherent danger can be tempered by joining one of tdome's many gangs which offer a variety of advantages. Sanctioned gangs have their own bunkers from which to operate, and which offer cut rate rent costs and equipment repair.</desc>
    <desc>If you are the sort that enjoys walking on the wild side, come seek the challenge of survival in a world gone mad. There should be plenty of room to accommodate you...Hell ain't half full yet. :)</desc>

    <desc>Over a thousand years since the Shattered Wars, the world has become very much rebuilt and the dragons, although still around, seem to have relinquished control. Three lands have risen to become civilizations, the most prosperous still looked after by dragon kind but each having its own ruling government: The first a realm where things that humans would have considered fantasy have become common. Not just dragons but also elfkin and others have claimed it as a homeland, all ruled over by an unpredictable Elven king. A second land, under a human Empress, has become a prosperous one that's strikingly medieval in feel. Mostly a human population this land also controls the largest of ports and is often a stop for travellers also giving the most motley assortment of peoples to be found. Finally the third land, one that has tried to rebuild the advancements that humans once had, is a slowly rebuilding reminder of the post-apocalyptic future that humans have had to endure. Controlled by the iron fist of a General, this land ranges from the broken runes of the old world to newer buildings and some suspect hidden technologies.</desc>

    <desc>The power of the human mind is both infinite and terrible. Mankind is capable of both selfless love and unfathomable cruelty. Each of us possesses a world beyond the senses, a world which is the backbeat and underpinning of the waking, conscious world. There are those who have the power to channel the archetypes within them to achieve superhuman feats. This power is called 'Persona'. These are the stories of those people, who have, for better or for worse, have been granted great power... And how they decide to use it.</desc>
    <desc>Those who confront this realm of the unconscious are forever changed by the experience. Some are erased, some are twisted. But others find that they and the reflections they walk among are one and the same, and through this, prosper. Great forces have been set into motion by those who understand this power, forces that could either save humanity, or doom it. What mask will you wear to confront the hardships of life? That choice is yours alone to make.</desc>
    <desc>Within the shadows of the cities of Japan, strange and incredible things occur. Where rumors become real, the reflection of a television might conceal the door to another world, and at midnight, time itself stands still. This all lurks just below the surface of the common, everyday waking life of the world, where by day men and women work and go to school, and by night seek out the reasons for this fantastic existence.</desc>
    <desc>PersonaMUSH is a new game based on Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei: Persona franchise. As Persona and Shadow are two sides of the same coin, both those who command the power of Persona and those who have allowed their Shadow to rule over them are available for application.</desc>

A world of kings, queens, and Aes Sedai, women who can tap the True Source and wield the One Power. At the moment of Creation, the Creator bound the Dark One away from the world of humankind, but more than three thousand years ago, Aes Sedai, then both men and women, unknowingly bored into that prison outside of time. The Dark One was able to touch the world only lightly before the hole was soon sealed over. But the Dark One's taint settled on saidin, the male half of the Power, and every male Aes Sedai went mad. In the Breaking of the World they destroyed civilization and changed the very face of the earth, sinking mountains beneath the sea and bringing new seas where land had been. Now only women bear the title Aes Sedai, men still are born who can learn to channel the Power, or worse, who will channel one day whether they try to or not. Doomed to madness, destruction, and death by the taint of the saidin, they are hunted down by the Aes Sedai and gentled, cut off forever from the Power for the safety of the world. Explore new lands in search of lost treasures and artifacts. We have more than 10,000 rooms open and many more on the way. Pit your skills in battle against the trolloc horde or the human infestation! Roleplay you character to its fullest potential and gain acceptance to and possibly lead one of our numerous clans!

Using a highly modified 2.4.5 mudlib, we have created a fun environment without the complexities involved with many of today's newer systems.  Though an older system, we offer many features to increase a player's fun. A guild system exists that allows players to specialize their character's abilities, as they explore the world of TravMud through our many areas.  These areas span from medieval fantasy to science fiction, but still manage to keep those areas seperate.  We have a few, very challenging quests which are only required for advancement to creator status.  Player Killing is by registration only, with registered players fighting amongth themselves without limit.  Finally, we have a responsive wizard staff who are open to suggestions for improvement, and are currently working on cleaning up some of the more pernicious bugs, and making the MUD more navigable.

The Gaians are a race of people who have evolved and developed technologically to co exist perfectly with nature, they are genetic engineering experts. When the colony ship first landed on Abyss all seemed to be going well further scans of the planet showed rich nodes of precious metal scattered through the mountain scape near which they had landed. But when clear cutting began for the new settlement which the humans wanted to build. The Gaians reacted the only way they could; they attacked.</desc>
    <desc>Alright so thats a little taste of the story line there will be three player selectable races humans, gaians and the human ally androids.</desc>

    <desc>Twilight is a roleplay-intensive environment, whose pivotal element is that of the myths and legends of creatures and beings hidden from the human world but very much part of it. Players should either make their characters into beings that can appear as human, or at least as a normal animal (such as a domestic dog or a sewer rat) in public, and have a true nature somewhat more paranormal (ie: Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, Faerie, etc.). Alternately, players can also play true humans, who may or may not have some kind of education in this strange world going on right beneath their noses. The city is dark, techno-gothic, and should have plenty of mystery.</desc>
    <desc>To get a better feel for the MUCK, we recommend visiting Twilight as a guest before you send email for a character. Innovation and creativity are encouraged in both character creation and tinyplot development! Players are allowed to make up their own 'race' to accomodate their needs, so long as it remains in theme and not overly powerful.</desc>

    <desc>Stick in the MUD, founded in February 1994, was one of the first ROM-based MUDs online.  Originally a hangout for displaced ROM players and University of Toronto engineering students, it quickly became populated with new mudders and evolved its own identity.</desc>
    <desc>Stick attracts beginning and experienced mudders who are looking for a simple, friendly, relatively clean ROM-based mud to explore.  It retains mudders who enjoy the diversity and spirit of community that endure year after year -- and it retains mudders who just... can't... resist... the urge to log on....</desc>
    <desc>As a game, Stick in the MUD is much like its name.  It doesn't change quickly.  This is not a 1000-area 80-race MUD with 100 people on at all times.  The implementors are a couple of boring ol' computer professionals who try hard not to take the game, their roles, or themselves too seriously.  They keep good backups, fix bugs, and otherwise sit around and socialize like most everyone else.</desc>
    <desc>For the player who prefers to keep running around killing monsters after reaching immortality, Stick offers a reincarnation option with expanded race/class selections.</desc>

    <desc>Are you tired of the same old Godwars muds? Maybe you like them, but wish there were more classes to choose from.  Perhaps you enjoy a place where you get to completely destroy your enemies.  Does this describe you? If so, welcome to War of Legend.</desc>
    <desc>Here we offer a broad variety of classes, most of which are completely original and exclusive to this MUD. Those that aren’t original have completely revamped skills and abilities.  With 6 base classes, 15 subclasses, countless variations of each and hundreds of skills to choose from, you have the ability to customize your characters like nowhere else.</desc>
    <desc>War of Legend does not play like a typical Godwars MUD.  Statistics play a significant role in your success. Items are generated with the randomness similar to that in Diablo II.  No two pieces of equipment obtained from creatures are ever exactly the same. There is also a set of unique items to purchase that will advance you to the highest levels of strength.</desc>
    <desc>War of Legend offers a special system of forging to enhance and upgrade your weapons and armor as you see fit.  With this system you can advance your equipment through six tiers of growth, each building on the previous tier.  With socketable jewels that add special bonuses to all of your equipment you can become a serious force among your adversaries.</desc>
    <desc>Gold is the currency here.  With it, you have the means to purchase uniques and forge your equipment.  You can purchase tattoos, which add a vast array of stats and enhancements to make you stronger.  Materia are available, which is an item that grows as you grow, each with a different and substantially powerful affect.</desc>
    <desc>You will journey through a progression of one hundred levels.  At the end of that journey you will have an opportunity to achieve mastery of your class. With mastery you gain an item and ability unique to your class that sets you apart from your peers as well as puts a definitive stamp on that class.  With each passing level you grow in strength, receive access to more skills, and develop more of a combat prowess.</desc>
    <desc>Combat in War of Legend is dynamic and diverse. Skills and abilities exist that support ranged combat, stealth combat, damage over time spells, arena combat and countless other features. The more you fight and win, the stronger you can become.</desc>
    <desc>So whether you prefer to shoot your enemies from a safe distance with a bow as a Sentinel, sneak up on them from the shadows as a Ninja, rip them to pieces as a Demon, call upon the forces of death as a Wraith or annihilate them with the jumping skills of a Dragoon, come see if you have what it takes to fight in the War of Legend.</desc>

The concept of Board Games and Tabletop Games predates most forms of writing, or so say the historians. From Mills to Chess, and Chess to wargames, and from wargames into Dungeons &amp; Dragons, gaming has evolved and grown until it became one of the most popular pasttimes for families and friends the world over.</desc>
    <desc>TableMUSH is a social environment; a world of gaming whose philosophy is that all games--no matter how they are played or why, so long as they bring two or more players together, they should be welcomed here.

    <desc>Korongil is a world of fantasy, where demons and sorcerers battle knights and kings. The darkness of evil Moralan is growing once more, and the forces of light build their strength to rise up and oppose it. What will happen? Is war inevitable? Within this struggle you will find common men and women who shall rise to become legends, will you be one of them? Only time, and RP, will tell.  The theme of Korongil is a pseudo-medieval setting of fantastic proportions. The struggle between good and evil is spread throughout all levels of existance, from the lives of mortals, the world's nations, even to the deities responsible for this reality. The tides of war and peace flow throughout the past, present, and future, carrying the whims of mortals and immortals alike. The essence of sorcery surrounds all that exists, offering its power to all who have the strength to wield it. Fantastic creatures inhabit the wilds as the sentient races build Korongil's nations within their cities. The path the world will take relies upon the choices of those who struggle within its reality.  KorongilMUSH offers interesting Role-Playing within its original fantasy world. You can portray one of the many inhabitants of this vast and varied world. Select to play any of our standard races, from the dour dwarves to the brutish xyloks, and perhaps earn the role of one of our more restricted species. Explore the nations of Elduran and Moralan while taking part in the intrigues and events that swirl around you. Your actions can shape the world. Justice or tyranny, life or death, the choice is yours.</desc>

Full array of prime and non prime skills for all classes, though each class has its strengths and weak- nesses. Advanced classes may participate in Order vs Chaos pvp.  Grouping bonuses are extravagant.  A land were even objects level and some turn into artifacts, no 2 leveled objects will end up the same.  A fast, fast paced mud environment, not for the feint of heart. Players may also choose difficulties, such a roughneck for life based perma death, hardcore for only one life, or opt out by being normal.  For an added challenge, Anarchy characters may spend their existence being aggro-magnets to the entire realm.  Travel system allows for transport from towns to unlocked zones, while the squad system attempts to incorp- orate many standard client functions.  The event and quest generator offers a dynamic land which is ever changing in its hostile nature.  A land where all mobiles grow and get stronger over time, and even have emotions which change based on character actions, a world rich in treasures and power, for those who survive.   Ability descriptions are now available in the practice window, covering all of the 320 available levels a character may attain, and levels are far cheaper across the entire spectrum.   For exploration, there are some 140 zones to explore, 870+ abilities, even an unlimited, gold based storage vault for each character.</desc>
    <desc>Features like scan, astrological bonuses, a calendar and solar/lunar holiday system, forges, uncrippled-throw, dual wield, permanent tattoos, spell memorization, weapon proficiencies, in-game exp counters, auto stabbers, health reporters, autoloot/split/sac, with a variety of prompts and a very swift split second combat system.</desc>

We have had U.F.P. mud since back in 1994 and are still running and changing. That's 12 years of knocking goblins in the head with a standard issue sword and lighting your path with a small orb of magical fire. A very long time indeed. Some of the original players still play the same characters they started back when we were just beginning. We encourgage new players as well as players that have been to many muds to give us a try. Our mud environment is newbie-friendly and there is a great spirit of helping and caring among those of us here. It is a great place to come and be with friends and kick back and relax. If you don't feel like killing Romulans, you can just chat about things going on in your life and the world with others who share your views.</desc>
    <desc>We are adding new areas and themes which are unique and fun for players. Player ideas are encouraged and often added to our world, including ideas for new areas. Our mud blends Star Trek with D&amp;D and a bit of the things you grew up with all in one place. You can walk through Starfleet command headquarters and interact with the personnel, or you can board the Enterprise and fight the Romulans and Klingons side-by-side with the crew. You can even take a shuttlecraft from area to area or board the New York subway. Some areas are quite challenging and keep even the high level players on their toes. In a time where graphical MMORPG are leading the pack for internet gaming, it is nice to return to a simplier time and a way that anyone could do and didn't mean funnelling a lot of cash into online subscription fees, upgraded graphics cards or buying player files. The old way of 'just mud and have fun' is still vital and important. Muds are still here, we will continue to be here as long as there are still orcs and goblin over-running Midgaard and Moria.</desc>

    <desc>Dark Metal MUSH: Cyberpunk-themed Old World of Darkness - set in a battered post-apocalyptic world after the Fall in which the existence of the supernatural was irrevocably proven to the eyes of humanity. This is Corp-controlled LATMA (the Los Angeles-Tijuana Metropolitan Area), where Bright citizens have all the rights under the watchful eye of the Consortium, and Dark residents don't even exist legally - which some of them prefer.</desc>
    <desc>Plots are ongoing and lively, with both staff plots and strong encouragement for players to develop and run their own. Here are some of the things currently ongoing:</desc>
    <desc>Having retaken a fallen caern, the GAROU begin the efforts to build it into a stronghold in the midst of the city, to hold against the pervasive influences of the Wyrm.</desc>
    <desc>The MAGES and SORCERERS, having secured a strange temporal shard, undertake to shape it into a safe space for magic-workers.</desc>
    <desc>LATMA has long been a frontier territory for the CAMARILLA, with success that waxes and wanes - a strategic location for Kindred as well as mortal politics. Now, however, they have begun creation of a center of power in Escondido, and are recruiting support from the long-time residents toward developing a secure Elysium location.</desc>
    <desc>The SABBAT have made a recent discovery of a 'psychic space' called the Oubliette. The Oubliette is a place of both wonder and horror with ancient roots that may contain the power to start or stop Gehenna.</desc>
    <desc>Like a southern California fog, the ragtag LATMA pride of BASTET fade in and out of view.  Recent events have put them on the path of a dubious artifact, to say nothing of the other myriad secrets the cats pursue.</desc>
    <desc>CORPORATE warfare is a constant; want to run errands doing their dirty laundry, dodge Metropolitan Security, or maybe try to take over a corp of your own?</desc>
    <desc>Dark Metal MUSH is open-chargen across the board for starting-level characters - Vampire, Mage, Sorcerer, Garou, Ratkin, Bastet, Corax, and cyber-enhanced Human. Plots are open to the playerbase at large - if you want to get involved with any of the above, just drop a word to a staffer. We'll work you in. Got an idea for a plot of your own? Our guidelines for running Player-Run-Plots not only allow but encourage it. Come tell your stories.</desc>
    <desc>Averaging from 20-40+ players, there's plenty going on for anyone to get involved in, supported by extensive, ever-evolving and maintained custom code. Also, have a look at our webpage for extensive theme and information files, active forums and rules discussions, staff agenda, and other up-to-the-minute information.</desc>

    <desc>The labyrinth which you find yourself trapped in is dark. It's impossible to tell the different pathways from each other, and all attempts to retrace your own steps have failed. You are hopelessly lost.</desc>
    <desc>But... is that a faint glow in the distance? You haven't noticed that light before, perhaps it leads to the outside! Your heart leaps as you quickly stride toward its source, your mind so focused on the distant light that you fail to notice the claw marks and patches of scorched blackness on the surrounding walls.</desc>
    <desc>Finally you find yourself in a large cave, and at last you see the source of the light, the flaming maw of a dragon! You try to flee, but panic seizes you, and your feet freeze in their tracks. In what seems like an eternity to your racing mind, the dragon lowers its massive and scaly head and crushes you in its powerful jaws!</desc>
    <desc>You fall into the arms of a tall powerful woman, dressed in a sparkling suit of full armour, and wearing her long hair in twin braids down her back. She cradles you in her arms like you were a child and whispers, \"Fear not, warrior. I am a Valkyrie, sent by the gods to take you to...\" 				 VALHALLA The MUD, from the programmers who created the original DIKU MUD and now maintained by Whistler.  * A fully automated \"Newbie Guide\", for those completely new to MUDs, or just wanting a little bit of a helping hand to start.</desc>

    <desc>The players take on the roles of students on an International Fleet space station and interact with each other and the teachers.  Specially selected children (chosen for their intelligence and determination) arrive to the station as 'launchies', the low of the low newbies, of approximately 6 years in age.</desc>
    <desc>Eventually, these students are promoted to 'armies' that compete in battle games set up by the teachers.  Some of these soldiers will become Toon Leaders.  A few, Commanders.  By the time of graduation, at about age 14, each child will have made many friends and a few enemies, and learned the abilities they need to become skilled soldiers, strategists, and pilots for the International Fleet.</desc>
    <desc>That is, so long as the teachers don't break the young recruits by pushing them too hard, desperate to discover the child commander destined to lead Earth to victory against a deadly alien race, the Formics.</desc>

    <desc>From lowest to highest, they are: mortals, eternals, and wizards. Mortals are the newbies, eternals are more experienced players, and wizards are those who choose wizardry instead of becoming an eternal.

    <desc>Vincent's Hollow LPMUD, established on April 28, 1991, is one of the older LPMUDs on the Internet.  Its founders come from the classic LPMUDs of the 1990-1991, such as SunMUD, SherlockMUD, GraniteMUD, Darker Realms, and Shattered World.  VH, as it is affectionately called by its players and  wizards, was established with the simple principle of being different, at a time when a lot of LPMUDs were constructed of the same stock world with a church, a humpedback bridge, an orcs' cave, and Leo the Lion.  It was one of the first LPMUDs to install a player-operated guild system, multi-class and skill system, and advanced magic casting.  VH also focuses on other 'fun' factors other than your everyday 'role-playing'.  We have various on-line games you can play with your fellow adventurers.  We also sponsor real life parties (most of them in Iowa) where players and wizards from around the country come and join us couple times a year to have real life fun (usually for Halloween and New Year).</desc>

    <desc>Mudders Delight offers a variety of balanced classes. We recently added a shinigami and quincy class based on the popular anime \"Bleach\".  In addition to rune eq, we offer chaos and senesce eq which far surpasses class eq. PK is encourage, however there is a fightarena for friendly sparring. Each class has its own class recall, giving each class an added bonus for residing in its \"home\". Mudders Delight was founded in 2002, but I recently decided to resurrect it from the dead.

    <desc>The generation of new peasants, lords, knights and kings have established a new world, a new land recreated but nothing of the past realms of Aadaria.</desc>
    <desc>Once ruled by Shimtis, the mortal followers of Jaal, Praegus, Neka and Tziru and the others have ventured into different realms ... only one, Defari has since then lived in the inner realm of Aadaria.</desc>
    <desc>In hiding, Defari had an apprentice, Rzarecta, who spent many years living in hiding. The apprentice grew and aged and is now the lone ruler of the Aadarian realms.  After his travels through distant lands, Rzarecta came upon two entities, Alton and Shryp who were creators and overseers of the new Aadaria. The two deities helped recreate the world with the old and has provided new creations for adventurers and travellers.</desc>
    <desc>What they did not know was that their creation also brought an evil existence somewhere in Aadaria, somewhere still unknown.</desc>
    <desc>Many adventurers, travellers have come to find this evil force and to rid of it. Those living in the realms of Aadaria have scattered about. Some hiding out while others remain around the area.</desc>

    <desc>X-Men Mythologies is an X-Men/Marvel Comics themed game centered around the fabled students of Professor Charles Xavier. Unlike most other X-MU*'s (as they are so fondly called), X-Men Mythologies has five total playable 'worlds' in which to choose from once you've applied for a character. The cutoff date for the Mainstream world is about the time of 'Legion Quest' (And the Age of Apocalypse). Non X-Men characters *are* permitted, as long as they are from a Marvel Comic. As well Non Feature/Orginal characters are welcome, but must be Earth-based and not cosmic powered Mutants.</desc>
    <desc>The other four worlds outside of the Mainstream world are: Days of Future Past - A dark future where mutants are hunted and killed or placed into concentration camps by the massive Sentinel robots that dominate America.</desc>
    <desc>The Age of Apocalypse - The High Lord Apocalypse rules America in this alternate reality and mutants reign supreme through his 'survival of the fittest' dogma.</desc>
    <desc>Medieval Utopia - A completely original and invented medieval fantasy setting.</desc>
    <desc>Millennium - Somewhat like a 'Year One' theme (for you DC fans), the Millennium world is not unlike the X-Men Evolution cartoon. Note, however, that it is *not* an X-Men: Evolutions world. Closer to the short run/limited Children of the Atom comic.</desc>

    <desc>Ashavar's Legacy is a mud that is challenging and realistic while still being a lot of fun.  Its focus is more on using your brain than pure hack and slash, player killing, or role-playing.  There are puzzles built into the game and randomized quests available.  Players can ask most humanoid mobiles questions about how to find stores, guildmasters, or puzzle hints.</desc>
    <desc>This mud uses a race-less and class-less system.  The players choices of stats determines what spells and skills he or she can learn.  Players can increase their spells or skills by using them, instead of spending practice sessions.  Players can also learn skills like mining, wood working, and leather working so that they can forge their own equipment.  They can find gems to give bonuses to forged items, runes to make their weapons cast spells during combat, and glyphs to give their shields protection from a spell.</desc>
    <desc>There are also many client-like features built right into the mud, for example aliases, autoactions, and some very advanced wimpy commands.  Other unique features include specialized containers, a dress command that can calculate the best equipment in your inventory and wear it, and the ability to study a given room, then teleport to it later.  We also offer a free client on our web page.</desc>

We have gone through a recent 'downtime' but have reloaded the database and are working on making improvements based on player suggestions.  Were currently in a 'semi-open' phase in which we will stat characters, work on chargen, and run a few 'light' plots.</desc>
    <desc>The game is based in Horizon City and is in a 'reboot' phase.  This means were starting over, no old characters will be 'resurrected' (see our policy on character resurrection), and players are welcome to restart their characters or make something new.  Were a small game, but hope to expand to the 50+ nightly connections again.</desc>

This also means that Full Disclosure is still necessary, as the Ballybran symbiont is still a closely guarded Guild secret. People applying to the Heptite Guild for membership should not have knowledge of the symbiont until after disclosure.</desc>

    <desc>--------------------------===[ UPDATE! ]===------------------------- ZombieMUD has been chosen as the Game of the Month for February 2006 by www.MudMagic.com! Mudwide celebration has ensued, so feel free to join the party now! -----------------------------</desc>
    <desc>Since 1994, ZombieMUD has been on-line and bringing orc-butchering fun to the masses from our home base in Oulu, Finland. We're a pretty friendly bunch, with well over 100 players at any given time logging in from all over the globe to test their skill in our medieval role-playing environment.</desc>
    <desc>Like freedom? With sixteen seperate guilds (classes), over fifty sub-guilds, and thrice a dozen races to choose from, you can play any sort of character you wish. Should you become tired of one class, then have no fear, simply take a near painless reincarnation and start your life with us anew without losing all your precious experience gained in the past. Your choices are near endless, and you can even play a character as odd as a mage-fighter if you desire. In the end, we leave it up to you.</desc>
    <desc>Love to collect? On ZombieMUD you are given the opportunity to build and customize your own personal and permanant castle. Within its stone walls you may hoard chest upon chest of goodies, gathered from througout the realm. You may even amass your own standing army to defend your castle from wiley intruders.</desc>
    <desc>Want quests? We've got them. Well over 200 various quests and specially designed 'Equipment mobs' stand ready to challenge your skill in battle with more tricks than Houdini himself. Hate quests? That's fine too, as while doing quests will lessen level costs, they are absolutely not required for advancement within the game.</desc>
    <desc>Enjoy interaction? On ZombieMUD we love to party. Fightin' and Killin' being specialties of ours most enjoyed in mass. While fighting solo is a staple of some player's diets, others enjoy the thrill of the group hunt. During a party you team your skills with the skills of other guilds to bring down foes of legendary size and strength. Whether you're a soloer or one who loves to interact, you will find your niche here.</desc>
    <desc>Admire progress? ZombieMUD has been continuously growing and changing for over a decade, and it shows. Our lands are vast and our treasures varied. Our staff is active and attentive to the mud itself, constantly adding new areas, or improving the old to be certain that Zombie and its players always have something new to discover.</desc>

    <desc>Hierher hat sich Merlin, der alte Zauberer zurueckgezogen, als er damals von seiner Schuelerin in Stein gebannt wurde, um unentdeckt sich auf eine Rueckkehr vorbereiten zu koennen. Dabei stiess er auf so einige einheimische Voelker und so manche Geheimnisse, die ihm in den Bann zogen ... Im Tamedhon erwartet dich eine gute beschriebene und ausbalancierte Fantasywelt, die einem leicht dem Alltag vergessen laesst und zum Spielen einlaedt. Es versucht, wirklich Fantasy und eine stimmige Mittelalteratmosphaere durchzuhalten, ohne neuzeitliche Klischees einzubauen oder staendige Referenzen zu diversen Romanreihen zu enthalten. Das MUD waechst bestaendig und bietet auch ungewoehnlichere Voelker zum Spielen an. Ausserdem ist sehr anfaengerfreundlich gestaltet.</desc>
    <desc>Auch wenn der Fokus mehr auf das gesellige Beisammensein liegt, bietet das Tamedhon auch weniger friedvolle Naturen genuegend Platz, um Drachen, boesen Schatten, fiesen Zauberern und untote Horden, die nach dem Blut der Lebenden duersten, mit Schwert und Magie Einhalt zu gebieten. Wer will, kann sich sogar als Kopfgeldjaeger betaetigen, dieser Spielerschlag scheint sich im Tamedhon besonders wohl zu fuehlen....</desc>

It had been started as an attempt at a biological weapon by a group of terrorists back in the early 2000s. The virus spread unnoticed across the globe. All life forms that experience some form of puberty were affected. This virus altered the strand of DNA that is supposed to protect and regulate the integrity of an individual's genome. The mutated portion essentially disables all or part of that activity, thus allowing many other mutations and gene swaps to appear and survive. This altered DNA was passed down to all subsequent generations and now each child is faced with the chance of undergoing life changing mutations in their teenage years.</desc>
    <desc>The MUSH revolves primarily around the interactions between those who have been changed by MORFS and those who were not. MORFS has changed the face of the world as humans know it, but some things remain the same. Those who were affected have, for the most part, been accepted in society. However, as always there are some people that view MORFS victims as lesser beings, especially those that have become animal hybrids. There are even some religious fanatics groups that believe those affected by MORFS are possessed by demons. The affected are not entirely blameless either, however. There have been groups of MORFS victims that have banded together, believing that they are superior to humans in all ways.</desc>
    <desc>The changes MORFS can have on a person are almost limitless. So come join us and enter the world of MORFS.</desc>

    <desc>This new Weyrmount is the virtual home of members of the Ultima Dragons- Internet Chapter. It is modeled after the ideal world of a host of turmoil-sick dragons -- intelligent dragons, with the knowledge and power to build beautiful cities in the mountains and wonderous tools and works of art.  Most Dragons hold close kinship with the mystical land of Britannia (the land in the majority of Origin's Ultima series) but, as the concept is of dragons who have fled terrible catastrophy on Britannia through a magical portal, this new land is -not- Britannia. Perhaps it is one of the other lost continents of that world; perhaps it is an entirely new world altogether. There are still two moons in the sky (Trammel and Felucca, by observation) and much of the wildlife is the same, but there the similarities end. The Dragons are all pioneers here, out to explore and tame this fabulous new world, and make it their new home.</desc>

    <desc>Cthulhumud is set sometime in the 1920's, with an additional fantasy Dreamlands area. In a setting where the elder gods reign from afar, foreign invaders lurk around the corner, and your sanity is threatened at every turn, Cthulhumud builders do their best to remain faithful to the works they read (or claim they do at least).</desc>
    <desc>We are currently small in population, but are looking to bring old players back and regain our previous size. We are still using the heavily modified DIKU mud (Driver: Cthulhumud v9.x), however a brand new C/SQL driven code base is nearing completion.  Come by and visit the Mud and our website to keep up with the new developments.  Even under normal circumstances we do not have a static world- this is a place that keeps you on you toes from the first day and for years to come.  We have a little over 8000 rooms right now with over 7000 new rooms in the works.  Each room is done individually by the Immortal staff; none of it is computer generated.</desc>

Well, it's back, and I'm hoping to get some interest in it going. It's a heavily modified GodWars, I forget which base it originally comes from, but it's not like any other GodWars out there. We feature:</desc>
    <desc>* Custom coded fight code. * No more stances, martial arts instead (still being modified, but fully integrated). * Only custom classes, not a whole bunch right now, but working on more. * Options for Cybernetics or Magic Tattoos to help customize your character. * Custom coded quest code, still adding more features to it. * Currently working on a random item generator for when you kill mobiles, for treasure, you know?</desc>

    <desc>*  WARNING: MUD CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT  * Akashat, the city of dreams. A nexus point for the collective subconscious of all humanity, indeed, of perhaps even worlds yet explored. It is here one may find the most powerful of dreamers, those taken from their former lives, remade in an often stylized image of themselves, and trapped within the city.</desc>
    <desc>The city moves, floating from one end of an expansive desert to the other, never twice at the same place, never truly more then ethereal. Dreams are the only way to access the city and those who first began to find themselves here soon organized a caste system. The three classes, the Nobles, who rule, the Citizens, who usually run businesses, and the slaves, used and abused, who are cared for and pampered by the other two classes.</desc>
    <desc>Created from the very essence, the very souls of each trapped dreamer, the City dreamed into being two rulers for itself. Taking their names from the mythical fae of legend, Titania and Oberon control access to the outside minds of the slumbering. With the aid of the Dream Mercenaries, they control access to the true world's dreams and harvesting whatever they could find within them, be it riches, goods or souls. The Royal Couple now rules over Akashat, aided by a Triumvirat comprising the Emir, the Crimson Cardinal and the Saharan head of the Asrag Reejal. To help (or hinder) the Triumvirat, a House of Lords sits under the watchful eye of the Speaker of the House.</desc>
    <desc>Members of the Nobility plots and plans, in turn watching the Governement's every move, in between hosting lavish parties in their domains when there's no uprising or doom looming at the horizon.</desc>

    <desc>The world of Icesus is set upon the planet Aegic, a planet created long ago by a clash of the elemental planes. As a result of battles between the elemental Gods, the planet was recently covered completely in ice, except for the valley of Icesus. Having recovered from the shock and starting to rebuild cities and nations, the races of Icesus have already had one major war. Prepare to enter the changing and rapidly growing world of Icesus.</desc>
    <desc>Icesus is a very original LPMUD set in a seamless fantasy theme, and a vast world full of secrets to explore. Apart from the all original realistic combat system and an innovative spell system, Icesus also has a variety of interesting features sure to distract you from mindless expmaking. The overall feeling and mood of the world will hold you in its grip like an icy cold hand of a wraith. Run on a dedicated server/connection by an equally dedicated staff, Icesus is truly a refreshing exception in the general mud genre.</desc>

The project has been heavily modified from its original condition and the world is all original. Come and join in on the action where a sieging army of Mora - The dreaded creatures created by the Dark Warlord and the Hellish Tarpits, attempt to strike the city on almost a daily basis, fighting their way closer and closer to victory. Will you fight off the invasion and become victors, bringing peace to the land or should you fall and become slave to the enemy so hated that most would rather kill themselves than suffer under the Dark Warlord, it's up to you to decide the fate of Bal-Travas, the small outpost in which you will reside, build and fortify your defenses and bring the Morian armies down, rise up and expand into the wastes, create a city or fall and have everything you know destroyed, only to be rebuilt again. With player driven plots like those mentioned above, you are sure to influence the world around you in ways never thought of before. An in-depth karma/respect system will ensure that NPCs act accordingly to your status in areas of the game and that by doing certain activities, your karma may be altered and the same NPCs you spoke to earlier may now become your enemies because you killed their child â€“ Your fate is up to you, you decide.</desc>

    <desc>The Old Republic: (3653 BBY)</desc>
    <desc>For 25 years the war between the Sith Empire and the Republic has continued. Utilizing various ruthless tactics, including the recruitment of the Mandalorians, the Sith continue to seize territories such as the Minos Cluster, while destroying the shipyards at Sluis Van. With many in the Senate believing the war unwinnable, a peace summit is called. While in attendance, a strike force of Sith led by Darth Malgus assaults Coruscant, destroying the Jedi Temple there and forcing the signing of the unbalanced Treaty of Coruscant and ending the war.</desc>
    <desc>Factions within factions abound as Jedi and Republic military splinter cells believe that the fight should continue, many disagreeing on how. Struggles for power within the Sith, as the mysterious Sith Emperor disappears, also aid in the propogation of a new Cold War between the Sith and the Republic and tensions are high as every sentient in the galaxy watches nervously for signs of another Great War.</desc>
    <desc>Will you join the Sith Empire or aid a recovering Republic? Will you follow the Light Side of the Force or gain power in the darkness of the Sith? Forge new hyperspace lanes in your own ship or smuggle much-needed (and quite valuable) goods to those who can make it worth your while? Make your choice, make history.</desc>
    <desc>The Rebellion Era: (1BBY)  It is a time of great strife and confusion throughout the galaxy. Order 66 failed to completely wipe out all of the Jedi, giving each a terrible choice. Go into hiding, choosing exile and isolation in the hopes that the Force would reveal what their course of action should be, or join the new Galactic Empire, becoming Sith apprentices under Lord Vader's guidance and falling to the Dark Side of the Force as they ruthlessly begin the hunt for their previous allies.</desc>
    <desc>Yet there is hope. A resistance movement has begun to be whispered about amongst those who yearn for freedom from the yoke of the Empire. Cells have sprung into being in small pockets across the galaxy, multiplying and spreading until at last, now, a fledgling Rebellion has taken root.</desc>
    <desc>Will you heed the call to arms of the Rebellion? Will you hunt these rebels into extinction and forever crush the idea of resisting the mighty Empire? Or will you remain on the sides, making profit and staying out of affairs that do not concern you unless you are paid to be concerned?</desc>
    <desc>Our MUSH takes place during two different times in the Star Wars universe. The Old Republic side begins just before the Jedi Civil War, roughly 3653 BBY while our other timeline begins at the dawn of the Rebellion era, at 1 BBY. You are able to create characters in BOTH timelines, though for obvious reasons these characters won't be able to ICly interact. Each generation will have a separate grid to RP on with old fan favorite locales as well as some new places to experience and explore. We are a modified D6 system, with code generously ported from Star Wars: Unsung Heroes with permission and modified by our staff.</desc>

Grand Admiral Thrawn led the Galactic Empire into a new era, restoring some of it's former glory and managing to secure several key systems for the Empire before falling victim to an assassination at the hands of his personal Noghri. Unable to secure Coruscant as the Imperial seat of power, the Empire has claimed Bastion as their throne world and established numerous bases and fleets in the systems and sectors surrounding it.</desc>
    <desc>In reponse to the threat that Grand Admiral Thrawn posed and the threat that the Galactic Empire continues to pose, the New Republic under the leadership of Chief of State Leia Organa Solo remains vigilant in their defense and protection of their member worlds. Military funding remains a key focus and diplomatic relations with Independent organizations and worlds continues to be top priority for the fledgling government.</desc>
    <desc>Stuck in between both sides are the Independents who are struggling against two powers that are vying for each others destruction. Some have managed to capitalize on the war, serving both sides and drawing a tidy profit, while others have fallen victim to it, their entire livelihoods destroyed within the blink of a eye. Mercenaries, Bounty Hunters and Smugglers run rampant in the galaxy, while businessbeings of all sides are now forced to choose who they are going to support.</desc>
    <desc>Will the New Republic be able to finally bring peace to the galaxy, or will the Galactic Empire once more thrust the galaxy into a state of chaos-laden war? Only time will tell. Join the fight and help make a difference for the side of your choice.</desc>

    <desc>You know the rest. Whether you're spotting Superman or Warbird, fighting bigotry alongside the X-Men, or prowling the streets of Gotham with Batman, you know that feeling. Heroes Dreams is a MUX founded on the belief some characters deserve to be played and fit well into a shared universe. Maybe you remember the \"good old days\" of superhero MU*'s, or perhaps you look back fondly on a time when you felt more connected to the comics. Maybe you're new to the genre, or perhaps you've read all the latest issues. Whatever sort of player you are... welcome!</desc>
    <desc>In the world of Heroes Dreams, we have reimagined DC and Marvel comics into one shared universe. At present, the MUX's theme lies somewhere between \"year five\" and \"year ten\" -- The Justice League and Avengers are well known heroes, the original X-Men are in their twenties, and Xavier's school has expanded to include many new students as the Mutant population grows and the public still grapples with how to accept them.</desc>

    <desc>Macross: New Horizon is a roleplay MUSH based upon the anime series Super Dimension Fortress: Macross (a.k.a. Robotech the Macross Saga).</desc>
    <desc>Set 40 years after the events of Space War I the MUSH chronicles the travels of the Horizon colony fleet, a massive city in space that's being sent to the other side of the Milky Way galaxy. This is not a safe journey either as the route is rife with mercenaries, pirates, and even the AUN - a terrorist/guerilla force that is opposed to the current UN government that's responsible for keeping the current alliance of humanity and the Zentradi (a race of humanoid giants originally created as weapons) in check.</desc>
    <desc>The MUSH itself sports an extensive knowledge base, making it accessible to people who are both new to Macross and new to MUSHing. All you need is a love for sci-fi, mecha, rock and roll, and giant space amazons (no, we're not kidding). Feel free to swing by our website or log straight into the MUSH to see it all for yourself!</desc>

    <desc>Cleft is a mud that is great if you love to rp. Things from all places and times come together to form one very strange world. In cleft, you are the person they write stories about. You are the Villain or the Hero that shapes the destiny of the world around you. We have everything from rune mages to mech pilots. Join the eternal struggle for Balance between Chaos and Order, or just nail people to burning crosses... There is room for any type of storyline you wish to write.</desc>
    <desc>We have several basic classes: Ninja, Fighter, Knight, Mage (with perhaps more on the way), as well as prestige classes like: Dancer, Dragoon, Monk, Samurai, Summoner that you can apply for if your rp warrants it. We pride ourselves on the uniqueness of things we have come up with. If your race that you want to rp is not one of the races we have availible for creation, ask an immortal to change your ICrace and we can let you show up on the wholist as anything up to 9 characters in length. We also have customizable equipment slots and strings, letting you choose what you call the places you wear your equipment or even what order they are in if you wish. Our areas are all original (though you may recognize some of them from Final Fantasy or such). We have a world map that connects one area to another instead of your normal 'nnnneeeesssswwww' direction to another area its more like, 'Well you go kinda north east from Figaro, I'm sure you wont miss it.' We try and use progs to keep our city mobs up to date on gossip and world events, as well as filled with in area quests for you to solve for better equipment and items.</desc>

    <desc>A jewel in the dark, a spark among countless stars... Zoom in to a world, green, blue, white and brown... A landmass among others, a mainland clasped between icy fingers north and scorching sands south, bordered by three seas... Zoom in: green fields and dense forests, a wild land dotted with smoking villages, disturbing clusters in this primal scenery. Zoom in: a battlefield, two armies mixing, bronze sword against rough leather shield, shamans clad in beast skins rythming the fray with their blunt drums. A time of heroes. Suddenly, a lonely figure upon a hill, a feral vision: a girl covered by the sunlight... A single sun. The fight seems to stop, heads turn and breath is caught. A raised hand... Lightning pouring down from the heavens, destroying, consuming the warriors. Screams and shouts, death and destruction... Havoc.</desc>
    <desc>Uncovering this mystery will drive your journey in Frandum:</desc>
    <desc>What you need to do: - quest! There are currently around 1000 quests in Frandum! - explore and use the multiple automaps, discover the history (learn) - use and combine items to solve puzzles (think) - talk to mobiles and (only) sometimes fight them (interact) - roleplay, talk with our friendly Wizards and admins (live)</desc>
    <desc>What will help you do it: - almost unique code base (only 1 other MUD shares it) - very friendly parser supporting an extensive command list - extensive spell list (much more than: hurt, hurt more, hurt deadly) - original skill system (yes, there is more to skills than percentages and fighting) - PK limited to Wizards or a parallel world (the Tournament of Death) - Objects, monsters and room categories and sub-categories offering a limitless gameplay</desc>
    <desc>What will make you do it: - killing is not needed to gain experience: only questing is rewarding - coherent and original fantasy world, consistent background, encompassing world history. - guilds scattered throughout the world: quest to gain power and influence (Wizards can also choose a class) - a cosmic balance between the three gods can both change and be changed by every player - a unique language system, based on your race (hey, what did this elf just say?)</desc>

    <desc>If you've never seen our mud, allow me to provide a brief description. We are based on an entirely original world, that has over 20k rooms in numerous areas, and even an overland area for you to explore.  We have several cities, and a multitude of creatures and items in our world.</desc>
    <desc>We have some original classes and concepts, including squires, who can become Paladins and Anti-Paladins, and rogues which become Assassins. We strictly enforce RP, but our PK system is not restricted by code. PK must be RP'd to be legal, and we deal quickly and effectively with bad players.  We try hard to be as newbie friendly as possible, we have a helpful staff and our playerbase is quickly returning. In addition, we offer a system of faith-based Orders, that have places for players to assume leadership positions.</desc>
    <desc>If you're looking for a good place to RP with fun, friendly players, please check us out.  Also on the horizon is an OOC voice chat system that players will have access to, and a web page is in the works.  We had over 5 years of development before, and now we're back, and looking to move into the future.  Give us a shot, and I think you'll be pleased.</desc>

    <www>http://www.the-green-leaf.de</www>
    <desc>Website: http://www.the-green-leaf.de/ (no idea, why this information is listed crippled)</desc>
    <desc>This is my very own little virtual world i am working on, when i have the time for it.</desc>
    <desc>The theme of the world is fantasy, medieval. Role playing is welcome, but not required to play.</desc>
    <desc>The world right now is quite small (2545 rooms loaded...), but big enough to go exploring and have some fun for some time. But the world will expand soon.</desc>
    <desc>The basic idea of The Green Leaf is to have a world, where you can log on and have some fun, and not that the game forces you (too much) to do given things.</desc>
    <desc>Want to meet people, friends, and chat with them? Fine, go ahead!</desc>
    <desc>Do you want to be a strong warrior and kill the stongest monsters available? Okay, have fun!</desc>
    <desc>Want to make as much gold as possible? Maybe you can be a trader or a manufacturer, whatever you like.</desc>
    <desc>Are you bored with your earlier decision and want to try something else? Okay, no class system hinders you to change your profession, it's all up to you.</desc>
    <desc>Want to play quests? The server has a quest engine, and the first few quests are avaliable, more will follow.</desc>
    <desc>Do you want to play contests, like hide&amp;seek contests, PM contests, PK contests and such, and win prices? I am going to host such contests from time to time and you can host your own contests there too.</desc>
    <desc>Do you have ideas, suggestions? The server has a report command to report single line messages, and a forum is available, where you can post your ideas, critics too.</desc>
    <desc>Another interesting thing is, *HOW* you can play.</desc>
    <desc>1. using a telnet client or a MUD client of your choice (please read the rules about MUD clients and bots and automatism)</desc>
    <desc>2. using the applet client and play using a browser, which supports java (at the website of the green leaf)</desc>
    <desc>3. using a mobile phone/PDA/whatever using a telnet client</desc>
    <desc>So The Green Leaf is under development, but at least playable using various clients to connect, has a mediveal base, is classless and offers you more or less the freedom to do there what you want, by respecting the rules of the game (type rules in game).</desc>
    <desc>Rule #1 is: Use common sense and behave yourself.</desc>
    <desc>That should'nt be that hard to follow. Please don't be an idiot and respect the right of other players to enjoy the game, and everything should be fine :)</desc>
    <desc>Please keep in mind, playing The Green Leaf is a privilege, not a right, so breaking of the in game rules might, but must not be punished.</desc>

    <desc>Come join the fun at Fantasy Moon. We are loosely based on the works of Takeuchi Naoko-sama, and will accept any attacks and backround from the movies, anime, or manga. We also accept original characters, and normal, unpowered characters as well. We also allow minor powers on those who are otherwise mortals. We would like the feature characters played somewhat canon, but the rp tends to be wildly off canon. There are characters from all walks of life, including very rich, very poor, and disabled. Through the magic of RhostMush reality levels, we even have Spirits that only some people are capable of seeing.</desc>
    <desc>The main admin (Punk) tries to follow a schedule of primarily admin work on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and primarily roleplay on Fridays and Saturdays. Sometimes, she will appear on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday evenings, but don't expect to see her then.</desc>
    <desc>In the in-character world, our time period is some time after the defeat of Galaxia, after she was given the task of redistributing the starseeds. Something broke through a dimensional rift however, and captured her. In haste, she threw all the starseeds she still had remaining, so they scattered every which way, reawakening sometimes in different people or in the wrong place. The timeline has been effected by the dimensional shift as well, so nothing is quite like it should be. News plot and news theme give details, once you connect as a guest.</desc>
    <desc>New characters will most likely not have the old canon names but we are not disallowing it. Also, you can have your pick of arriving already awakened, or rping a scene (or several) that bring you to an awareness of your powered self.</desc>

    <desc>Nanvaent is not a simple game. It cannot be finished, for it expands continuously. It cannot be beaten, for its first and last goal is to provide you, the player, with entertainment. It can be approached in a myriad ways, and success at it is not reached by rote or mere button pushing. To become great in Nanvaent, you will need the talents simpler games do not require - cleverness and quickness of thought, communicativeness and cunning, perseverance and passion. We believe Nanvaent is enjoyed best through deep involvement with others, making friends - and sometimes enemies, debating and joking, forging alliances and competing with your fellow travelers in our world. At its most exciting, Nanvaent is a scene of touching friendships and bitter conflicts - a place of extremes, of both honour and villainy, and not a sugary, bland environment of easy progress, pointless experience gathering, or tedious, impersonal killing.</desc>

    <desc>Arkadia is a Hard Fantasy, roleplaying, Polish-language LPMud. Thanks to the generosity of Genesis, it runs on CD gamedriver and mudlib, changed and further developed by us. The main changes have been made to fit the Polish declension, to hide out-of-character information from the players, and to make some things more realistic. Thanks to this, Arkadia has a rich, highly detailed and realistic world, making a perfect roleplaying environment.</desc>
    <desc>Currently, we have domains based upon Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedzmin saga and Warhammers's Old World. Players have six classical fantasy races to choose from, and some rich-background race and occupational guilds and clubs to join. All elements of the world are subject to strict coding standards, which assures them to be detailed and unique, and to follow their domain's theme.</desc>
    <desc>All of the above wouldn't weigh a lot without the excellent players we have. They create most of the magnificent atmosphere and make the world vivid. If you feel you would like to be part of Arkadia, learn some Polish and join us! ;)</desc>

    <www>http://www.dark-isles.net</www>
    <desc>Dark Isles is an intense, text-based roleplaying adventure for those interested in developing an intricate character and joining other like-minded people to create a continually evolving story based within an originally themed world.  Here you will find no levels or classes, but instead tools to help tell the story, provide focus and background for your character and the setting. Your character can set up shop and sell clothes that you make with leather that someone else has cured from a hide that another character has hunted. You can build a hut, dig up shell-fish or scavenge the high-tide for useful items that may have washed up at the beach. Your character can gather herbs and experiment with alchemy using a mortar and pestle. The possibilities are endless.  ICly the game is set on two main islands, Heas (the Human homeland) and Tarkas (the Skrel'eth homeland). The world is populated with original races that have some basis on races found in a more traditional fantasy theme as well as the option of playing one of four special characters:  Wolfkin - People with the ability to transform into wolves. Dryth - People with the ability to read minds. Vek - People who follow the cursed one and require the blood of others to survive. Channeler - People with the ability to channel kha (the magical energy of Dark Isles).  Dark Isles is now officially open and accepting roleplayers who want to have an influence on the muds development, take on interesting roles, become the heroes and villains that people will talk about for years to come. And if you have an idea on ways we can improve the mud, we would love to hear it and discuss whether it would be suitable to incorporate into our plan for Dark Isles.  Note: Dark Isles is completely free to play. Roleplay/ICness is strictly enforced and a way of life.</desc>

    <desc>Shattered Lands was started in 1992, based on the popular series Forgotten Realms. It is a stable, well rounded MUD offering both Role-Play and Player-Killing with countless features added to both aspects of the game. We offer extended class and race selection, subraces, and encourage participation in clans and Role-Play. Class balance is taken very seriously, and with the hundreds of added spells, weapon capability and racial skills we ensure each race and class is not only fun, but fair.</desc>
    <desc>On Shattered Lands there is always something to do, from storming the enemies Clan Hall, the Battle Arena, Role-Playing or PK-ing with other players, Questing for new items at the town Quest Master or seeking the many quests scattered throughout the areas for a broad range of rewards.</desc>
    <desc>While we are fully developed, we are not stagnant about coding new features. Players are encouraged to post new ideas on the idea board, as we work to maintain a unique and growing world.</desc>

    <desc>The black silhouettes of dormant volcanoes, draped in mantles of verdant jungle, ringed in pristine white beaches, surrounded by expansive coral reefs, scatter across warm tropical waters. The native people are friendly, having welcomed outsiders into their lands and given them ample permission to build and relaxed laws under which to live. The economy is robust, bolstered by the visitation of 250,000 tourists every year. Resorts and casinos sit opposite the lagoon from corporate headquarters and an exotic marketplace.</desc>
    <desc>Beneath the glitter grows the universal cancer of corruption, seeded centuries ago. It has taken root, as insidious a poison as one can conceive. Non-extradition laws make the islands a refuge for some of the world's most vile criminals; an utter lack of firearms and drug laws encourage trafficking of items and substances prohibited and illegal in many other countries. Human lives are bought and sold here, where slavery is an acceptable practice.</desc>
    <desc>Age-old tradition weighs one side of a balance against a swift influx of modernization and technology: ancient practices oppose new industries, medicine and industrialization. The volcanoes are mined for precious diamonds and emeralds; the waters are hunted for fish. The natives still honor the old ways, even sentencing the worst violators of their immortal laws to three days on an island from which none has ever returned. What dwells in the deep jungle? What lives on islands not walked by man? What hunts in the vast sea?</desc>

    <ip>66.11.173.122</ip>
    <www>http://www.wocmud.org</www>
    <desc>The Worlds of Carnage is different from many of the other MUDs you have played. At the outset you can choose from many of the standard races for most muds, and you can choose from several places to make your home. Additionally you can choose to play with a class or without. Within the world the skills you obtain depend on the skills you have learnt formerly. Additionally, your primary stats have a bearing on the quality of your skills, so any race can learn any skill up to 99%, but depending on the relevant primary stats the effectiveness may be more or less.</desc>
    <desc>The Worlds of Carnage also runs on a micro gains and micro ticks system. This means that whenever you kill a creature, or perform a quest that has an experience reward, you make rolls for various stat gains at that time and not when you gain a level. On that note, there are levels in the game, but your level is dependent on your experience and as such can go up and down as your experience increases or decreases. Micro ticks are like normal ticks except rather than have you receive some kind of regen bonus every 60 seconds or so, the bonus you would have received is broken into multiple slices and applied over much shorter intervals.</desc>
    <desc>For the adventurer who likes attention to detail and variety, the Worlds of Carnage is almost entirely original with only a couple of small stock areas kept for historical reasons (and they are heavily modified). With 16 years of existence much time has passed to create rich and woderful places to adventure. Additionally, the Worlds of Carnage recently absorbed the MUD formerly known as Cythera (which originally split from WoC about 10 years ago). This has created a diverse system with multiple continents for adventure.</desc>
    <desc>Finally, for those that like the wierd and wonderful, or those who might be interested in building areas for WoC, we have a Web-based world editor which allows changes to be made from anywhere and reloaded into the game on the fly. Rooms, mobiles, and objects can take advantage of the BlobbieScript MUD scripting language to create amazing affects and behaviours. BlobbieScript is 100% backward compatible with the old easyacts system upon which even mobprogs are based. The difference is that BlobbieScript is a true scripting language and allows for on the fly variables, running context management, over 200 built in functions to do almost anything, and the -&gt; operator to access virtually every data element of rooms, mobiles, and objects. Additionally, commands, skills, and spells in the game can be completely written in BlobbieScript allowing for live update within the game without the need to reboot.</desc>
    <desc>So what are you waiting for, come get started and immerse yourself in a world full of challenge and entertainment.</desc>

    <desc>At this time, we are a development site that is about one year old (started Jan 7 2001).  We are seeking coders and builders to help make our world, however, because of a recent influx of new wizards, we would like you to write a significant letter of purpose that would clarify your goals as a wizard and the projects you are interested in.  Try not to be particularly fixated in this letter as your plans must be flexible enough to fit into the type of game world that MT is, which of course, you must look at before making any implementation level decisions.  To apply, send your e-mail to the listed address.  Our content is not very extreme, but we should say that this is not a 'family mud.'

    <desc>Dark Mists is a multi-user RPG game with 17 distinct races, 11 classes, 9 of which are divided even further into subclasses, dozens of quests (with more on the way!), and hundreds of skills and spells unique to their class, subclass, or race. We've developed a dynamic clan system and worshiping system where the players have an amazing amount of control over their clan and are directly in touch with their God. The Gods of Dark Mists are actively seen in the game and their wrath, and blessings, can be felt in all aspects of a character's life, and throughout the year there are days set aside as Immortal Holidays where the players receive periodic blessings from the Immortal whose holiday is being celebrated.  Our administrators are devoted to the game and friendly to the playerbase, yet we are firm in maintaining the rule of law. The playerbase themselves are creative and competitive, and quite friendly. But be warned, the atmosphere at Dark Mists is vibrant with roleplay and playerkilling both required to make a successful and strong character. You will need a strong heart and quick wit to carve out your legacy in Dark Mists.  The game is always evolving, always changing. There is always something new and exciting to learn or explore or to see. Come see for yourself.</desc>
    <desc>(8/15/2010: Dark Mists is now on a privately owned server. The long awaited warrior subs have been in since mid-March 2009, and since December 2009 the Houses have vied for the gods' favor -- stat boosts -- with House War Weekend. Alchemy was recoded to give each Enchanter a personal set of formulas, but they can be taught by one Enchanter to another Enchanter in game. Our 14th anniversary is coming up on October 21, 2010. The players have been clamoring for new players, so if you join us and are brand new to our game, be sure to say so in the question while rolling so that you can go through our newbie help area, and use the ooctell command -- ooctell [name of player] *message* -- to ask the current players for any clarification or guidance you may need. Some players have the word 'Helper' in front of their names, but even those who do not can prove helpful. Learning to die and re-arm yourself is important, as only the Immortals are immune to death.)</desc>

    <desc>Vanciamud is an continously developing RP oriented MUD, both by its universe and its functionality. A team of builders constantly gives its best to expand the game world and create new quests. The orientation of the characters is a little different from most existing MUD and certain commands or concepts deserve further explanation. Therefore a small in-game tutorial was developed to help you discover them at your own pace. More explanations on this MUD are given below in French:</desc>
    <desc>VanciaMUD est un mud fortement orientÃ© RP. L'univers, mÃ©diÃ©valo- fantastique, est dans l'ensemble assez sauvage et conÃ§u pour inciter le joueur Ã  trouver par lui-mÃªme des moyens de survivre et de progresser. Le systÃ¨me de progression a Ã©tÃ© dÃ©veloppÃ© pour que, Ã  la diffÃ©rence de beaucoup de MUDs, il ne soit pas indispensable de combattre pour gagner des niveaux. Les guerriers, bien entendu, ont une place dans l'univers, et une part non-nÃ©gligeable des talents. Toutefois, on peut Ã©galement monter un personnage magicien et, prochainement, devenir alchimiste ou botaniste (aucune limite n'est fixÃ©e Ã  ces orientations). Le systÃ¨me de classe Ã©tant largement informel, il est parfaitement possible d'avoir un joueur qui cumule plusieurs de ces aptitudes, mÃªme si Ã  un niveau moins grand bien entendu. Dans ces conditions, les quÃªtes prennent une importance primordiale dans l'univers, et les bÃ¢tisseurs s'attachent Ã  en dÃ©velopper un nombre toujours croissant. Les fonctionnalitÃ©s mises en place jouent plus sur l'intÃ©rÃªt et le rÃ©alisme que sur les dÃ©tails que l'on associe gÃ©nÃ©ralement Ã  ce type d'univers. Cela ne signifie pas que les dits dÃ©tails ne seront jamais implÃ©mentÃ©s. Vous avez pour l'instant largement de quoi faire avec le combat, la magie et les autres occupations plus inhabituelles (chasse, pÃªche, cuisine sur feu de camp...).</desc>

    <desc>Online since 2003, Chiaroscuro is an original-theme online roleplaying game that takes place in three primary regions: Fastheld, a walled city-state where magic is feared; Halagh, a series of mountain cities inhabited by gadget-loving Halaghi; and the Weeping Stones Islands, a cluster of islands in the sea off the coast of the continent where the pantheon-worshiping Moss Men dwell.</desc>
    <desc>Our primary focus is on roleplaying – acting out scenes involving multiple players – from small chance meetings to massive world-changing events. But we’ve got other features that make the game attractive for players around the clock:</desc>
    <desc>-More than 2,000 player-craftable items, which can be made and sold to other players, automated shopkeepers and auctioneers. -Lots to explore. It takes about 33 real-time hours, for example, to walk around the perimeter of Fastheld’s great Aegis wall. -MUDQuests, which allow players to test their skills for the chance to win coin and experience points. -Deedgivers, which reward players for completing a variety of tasks. -Trade system that lets players earn money and develop influence in the realm.</desc>
    <desc>Own land. Build a shop. Get a customized castle. Lead a guild. Insert yourself into webs of noble intrigue. Make a name for yourself as a superstar roleplayer or an eminent crafter.</desc>
    <desc>We’re always looking for new players to bring our realms to life. Some established players offer suggestions for new characters to move in their RP circles in the Wanted Characters section of our informational Wiki knowledgebase at http://otherverse.wikia.com</desc>
    <desc>The game is free to play, although we do offer some paid in-game enhancements (extra crafting minutes, fast horses, luck cards, and other goodies).</desc>

Eight different races, and eight character classes provide a wide range of choices when it comes to tailoring your persona, with four large Guilds to join, and sub-guilds too at later levels. The environment is non PvP, with a strong emphasis on roleplaying, the players ably assisted by the helpful staff to create a truly immersive gameworld. Help files are extensive, and all Guilds have their own mentor programs designed to ease newcomers into their new home. Cosrin is perfect for experienced roleplayers, who will fit right in and find the wealth of material they have to work with is only limited by their imagination. Cosrin is also *the* ideal choice for any true beginner, in both the roleplay and MUD sense - players use it's own trademark 'Wizard' front end to access it, which is fully configurable to your needs, but not so overwhelming that you are sent running for the hills by a three inch thick manual!</desc>
    <desc>Aside from the above, I can only suggest that you drop in and visit, you'll find plenty of people to help you upon your arrival, and we're always glad to see new faces across the bar! See you there...first drink is on us...</desc>

    <desc>In elden times, it is now said, Dragons ruled.  They created a civilization of immense beauty, sophistication, justice and law.  And then Sidal descended, and chaos ruled.  Now the races that were ur-races in Dragon times are struggling for power and control in this modern age.  Humans are ascendant from their main cities of New Draconia and Sidalicia, but never discount the others; the Faea, Grulorten, Ertlorten, Korylani, Velinga and Jotuni.</desc>
    <desc>This mud features carefully crafted zones, with detailed descriptions which change depending on daylight and season.  Mobs have personality, many offer quests, some offer puzzles, or jokes, many have tricks up their sleeves. The world of Sidalicia is intended to age, rulers of kingdoms will change, years and seasons will be marked in their passing.  Here weather and geography are important, and magical control and knowlege of both is possible.  Sidalicia is a new mud, just opened for players, and is therefore small and intimate.  It is a complex mud in some ways, many things have been changed from stock Circle, including the factors affecting combat.  Much thought has gone into making Sidalicia original, thoughtful and absorbing.  Roleplaying is encouraged but not strictly enforced and Sidalicia is exploring other ways, besides hack and slash to advance a character (most based on questing and knowledge of the MUD).  Come and join us, and fall under the spell of...  SIDALICIA!</desc>

    <desc>\"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more. \" -Albus Dumbledore</desc>
    <desc>1994. The Tri-Wizard tournament has left a sour note on Harry Potter's Fourth Year at Hogwarts. Death has come to the school right before a long, dreary summer of drought and murmurs of the Risen Lord Voldemort. The old loyals to the Dark Master, the Death Eaters, have broken free from Azkaban in the June of 1995 and have not been seen or heard from since. Some say it is a sign of the end, but many know this is foolish. The ministry has it's ears and eyes closed, turning a blind eye towards the matter. Harry Potter is a frequent topic in the Daily Prophet, his claims of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named being tossed aside as irresponsible rumors of a deranged teenager. There are rumors that Dumbledore is being asked to step down as Headmaster at Hogwarts. There are worse rumors that Dumbledore is being forced to step down. Witches and Wizards are going into hiding. Some children are not returning to Hogwarts. Half of Hogsmeade is closed, Diagon Alley shops are shutting down.</desc>

Turrosh Mok plots the demise of the entire Wild Coast and most notably the City of Greyhawk. All the while, Queen Yolande sits quiet, unwilling to commit elven lives to human wars. Paranoia strickens every government as the Scarlet Brotherhood seems capable of infiltrating even the most closed kingdoms. Immortals with their motives sit high above, watching their followers and enemies closely. Heroes of every alignment fight for their cause, while others fight for survival.

    <desc>Star Trek: Foundations is the first Star Trek-themed game based in the era of the \"Enterprise\" TV show.  Star Trek: Foundations (previously known as bDv) has been in production since 2001 and first opened for players in 2002.  In the fall of 2004, it was announced that the game was being redesigned from the ground up in terms of code - a project which would streamline the game and ensure that all aspects worked together.  ST:Foundations (bDv2) opened in March of 2005, and the playerbase was transferred over.  The game takes place a few years after the show.  However, after 2154, we follow an original timeline.</desc>
    <desc>The year is 2163, and the galaxy is in turmoil. Many talks have been initiated by various empires to discuss the need for an alliance of major powers. The Terran Confederation is trying to prove itself to larger, more-established empires like the proud Andorian Imperium or the stoic Vulcan Federation. The warrior Klingon Empire shows little mercy to those foolish enough to stand in the way of the Empire's goals, and the secretive Romulans watch all from the safety of cloaked vessels. Other, independent worlds are in the middle of it all, some trying to make a profit while others side with larger empires or conduct illegal business.</desc>
    <desc>Will you play a part in forming an alliance of governments? Will you command a raiding party of pirates? Will you lay siege to a weaker empire, or will you foster the bonds of peace? All of these options are available to you here.</desc>

For the pkillers, you can take part in a clan war, getting war points for your clan. For the explorer, you can hop on a horse (or, why not, a dragon) and use the automated quest system to get quest points that will be used to improve or modify your gear, while discovering new areas. For the newbies, you can be sure to receive help from your fellow players (we like the 'homely' atmosphere of a relatively small player base). If you ever get bored, you can participate in one of the regularly run games (capture the flag, treasure hunt, base domination to name a few). Or you could accumulate gold and buy your own castle! But the levelling possibilities are nearly limitless, with remorts (allowing multi-classing) and more than 300 races to choose from when you reincarnate.</desc>

He'd no idea some psychos would actually like it and play there all the time.  As a result of his efforts in the face of an 'all frills or bust' mudding community he quietly kept running one of the oldest Diku muds on the internet.  It has only taken massive hardware failure to allow Scott Davis a crack at vaguely more modern code to allow FieryMUD interim possession of a different and challanging player interface.  The origional vision of FieryMUD was to create a challanging MUD for advanced players. This new reborne Fiery is a hope to bring back the goals of the past by inflicting certain death on unsuspecting players...  FieryMUD will continue to grow and change through the coming years and those players who seek challange and possess imagination will come in search of what the 3D world fails to offer them.... - Zzur</desc>

Train your skills, gather equipment and ancient artifacts, amass a treasury, learn spells, and enhance your power.  Build cities, recruit and train armies, and lay enemy settlements to waste.</desc>

    <desc>Denver: Dark Alliance is a long running game which has recently been re-adapted in early 2008 by a new group of staffers. The game supports the classic Old World of Darkness Mage: The Ascension game.</desc>
    <desc>In Denver, Colorado, an eclectic chantry of the Council of Nine Mystick Traditions face nearly insurmountable odds against the stalwart forces of the Technocratic Union and their mortal sympathizers in the real world, and explore the strange, massive, and often dangerous wonderland of a chaotic \"other dimension\", a horizon realm birthed from the chantry's own node. Amid all this, rumors of a dark force which seeks not to consume simply our reality, but ALL realities persist. Will the power of the Awakened and their allies be enough to prevent the end of all realities?</desc>
    <desc>Magick and technology, friendship and love, and humor and horror combine into an exciting story adventure.</desc>
    <desc>We accept Tradition magi and their supporters only (mortals and psychics allied with the Traditions) but we are willing to discuss quite a few different concepts. We have an excellent group of very dedicated roleplayers who love the game, and a system that rewards cleverness, curiosity, and creativity.</desc>
    <desc>We do require that all players AND the characters they portray be at least 18 years of age.</desc>

    <desc>For many years, the kingdoms of  Dhanloria, Britannica, and the Farlands were united under the banner  of King Arthur Pendragon. But this time of peace would not last. King Arthur eventually passed on, and the three kingdoms split,  bickering over who should hold power. Alliances formed, and the world fell to chaos.</desc>
    <desc>Some formed clans and  orders, becoming self-sufficient. Others follow closely to their kingdom,  swearing allegiance and working on making them the rightful power in the realms,  and still others flee underground,  swearing  no  alliance,  but  forming small  bands  of mercenaries and brigands.</desc>
    <desc>The path  before you is not an easy one,  but no path is wrong. We implore you  to come and play,  and enjoy  what we have to offer. 500 levels, 16 classes,  and several races create a rich and vibrant world, filled with kind people, and plenty of game play.</desc>

    <desc>Decepticon Dominion Mush breaks new ground with the concept of a single-faction Transformer Mush, which allows a continued sense of progress, a steady change, and a history that builds upon itself. Decepticon interactions among themselves are every bit as fascinating, perhaps more so, than the usual Decepticon/Autobot conflict - because there's forever a fine balance between the sense of team loyalty and the continued drive to better oneself. There's tremendous interpersonal RP possibility, and even greater opportunity on a larger scale.</desc>
    <desc>This universe is firmly grounded in the pre-Movie cartoons, and characterizations are true to those given on the show. Excellent characters from other eras and universes are scheduled to be added as needed, to present the best possible mix of the greatest of the Decepticons, all brought together in one place.</desc>
    <desc>In the context of our theme, TFDD is committed to a non-restrictive and respectful environment for its players, and seeks to attract dedicated roleplayers who would like to be part of the adventure.</desc>

    <desc>The world of Aldria is as open as it can be, when you arrive there, you'll find a place where players create the present and future. Little has been written about the lands' past and present, less has been written about the races that roam the lands, and why is that?</desc>
    <desc>It is because this mush is made by the players. As more join, as more things happen, the rules will be written. How will magic work? The first to write it down will provide the base for those that follow, ever expanding, ever getting better and constantly adapting to the new realities.</desc>
    <desc>As of now it is known that there are 5 different 'nations' in the world. As time passes, some might vanish, others might appear... But the starting place for all, the one nation already partly set to stone is a magical kingdom on a mesa, one that resembles any other fantasy kingdom. And that's where your story starts (for now).</desc>

That gives plenty of history to all the characters and to the world in which the characters live for everyone to role play in.  FC's and OC's alike are welcome on the game and an easy application encourages new ideas.</desc>
    <desc>So far, there has been a Sentinel attack, exposing mutants to the world.  While there is some further acceptance than initially, humans still fear and loathe mutants on a whole.</desc>
    <desc>Raven Darkholme, aka Mystique, is no longer principle of Bayville High.  After losing the fight with Storm, and not being chosen to join Magneto on Asteroid M to go through his device which was supposed to bring mutants to their full potential, she snuck up herself, and got caught in the machine.  However, she maintained her presence at the school, in the form of Risty.  And though everyone thinks she was turned into stone to release Apocalypse, then broken into many pieces, she re-appears, her powers being amplified by Apocalypse, once he's released.</desc>
    <desc>Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters, along with the Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants have been exposed as havens for mutantkind, and the X-Men not only helped to keep Magneto from realizing his plan of world domination, but they defeated Juggernaut, Xavier's half-brother, when he came in search of Xavier.</desc>

    <desc>TriochMARE is a world with a completely player driven economy. Players can gather their own resources and make their own equipment. It is completely possible to play the entire game without ever engaging in combat.  The economy system is fully implemented at this time.</desc>
    <desc>The game will feature three unique storylines around a single background. Players will be able to complete the storyline and start over on the same or a different storyline.  Players who defeat the storyline will be allowed to keep skills permenantly allowing them to unlock new areas of the world.</desc>
    <desc>As the economy is driven by the players, a player base is needed. Early players in the game will have opportunities to gain more skills than the typical player will have. Playtesters are also adequately rewarded.  In addition, all players who help describe a room in the game get a reward of their choice.</desc>

    <desc>Dragonball Z: Legends is not simply an online game; nor even a glorified DBZ near-death experience - it is the hard work &amp; dedication of several of the best coders and builders to encapsulate you into the world of Dragonball Z like never experienced before. Goku and Piccolo will have nothing on you, as you plunge deep into this realm - enjoying the unique experience that only Dragonball Z: Legends can offer you.</desc>
    <desc>	To introduce you into this realm, I will summarize its history as a timeline of sorts. First there was Dragonball Saga - the first DBZ codebase that took mudding into the future for Dragonball fans. It was glorious, supporting, at times, over 400+ people from all over the globe. Then, tragically, as time went on, it faded and finally colapsed. Over several years, the codebase leaked out and several \"clones\" were introduced - each degrading the original experience more than the last. Now we get to Dragonball Z: Legends; which has areas that were in the original DBS, along with several, uniquely built areas by our team of dedicated administrators.</desc>
    <desc>What seperates Dragonball Z: Legends from other muds, or even other clones, is that there are several additions and expansions on the original mud that will leave you coming back for more. These range from more ki attacks, which are described as accurately to the show and manga as possible, to new transformations and new races never before seen in the realm of Dragonball Z! These include:</desc>
    <desc>- Hylians, from the realm of Zelda - Reploid, from the realm of Megaman - Shinigami, from the realm of Bleach (still in progress) - Fierian, a uniquely built race</desc>
    <desc>	The world of Dragonball Z: Legends is a constantly changing environment, which means as you play the game, it will evolve around you. The administrators are always hard at work making the player feel at home, both in the game as well as during conversation. They hold quests(which offer rewards), release supermobs(which drop rare items), and increase powerlevel gains during peak hours of gameplay. If all of this wasn't enough, it gets better - they also openly accept new ideas which, if well-organized, will be implemented. The administrators of Dragonball Z: Legends are:</desc>
    <desc>- Kalisto, the owner of Draonball Z: Legends and coder. - Zynon, an amazing coder and Kalisto's right-hand man. - Builders, including Serena, Ryusei, Dominic and Sepharic. - and always looking for more staff to enhance the experience.</desc>
    <desc>	From everyone here at Dragonball Z: Legends, we welcome you into our home and will treat you as a favored guest. Everything that is ours, is now yours - we only ask that you respect administrators and other players as you wish to be respected yourself. Have fun, and remember to enjoy yourself.</desc>

    <desc>Avalon is a consistent strict fantasy world which has shown to be able to fascinate its players for years and years on end. It is actively maintained and evolves continually, aiming at the best possible non-commercial, _completely_ free game play and fantasy atmosphere.</desc>
    <desc>The world itself is huge, containing three main continents with sub- continents, many very large metropolises to hidden villages, deserts, barren hunting grounds and, of course, the Underworld. A colourized map of your vicinity can be displayed everywhere you are to help your orientation. Each race and class/guild has its unique look, form of expressions and a specific way to it being played. Avalon strives to make each character you play a very distinct experience.</desc>
    <desc>Avalon officially went out of its beta-phase on August 15th 1995. At the time of this writing (2009) it has been greatly enhanced and still is one of the prime addresses for German speaking text-based gamers.</desc>

    <desc>Aesir currently has 6 tribes, run by mortals, that aid in roleplay and player interaction. Most of our areas are original and we will accept and review areas from anyone, not just immortals.</desc>
    <desc>We have Rebirth and Remort systems in the game. Remort will brings 8 advanced classes into the game. Questing is optional and the rewards are as variable as the types of quests. We like to try to keep a light, relaxed atmosphere, while at the same time keeping an open forum for opposing views.</desc>
    <desc>Feel free to stop by anytime and if you should need anything, don't hesitate to ask! Aesir II is a dedication to the origional Aesir (asgard.viviano.net). It was an incredible piece of work so the mud is being relaunched on a new port under new management.</desc>

Of course the main reason we all play online games is the other players, and our mud has the best group of people you are likely to meet in an online game. We have an active and helpful staff, players willing to help newbies, and an extensive help file system.

    <desc>This would seem like your typical DikuMUD.  It started with classes, and 30 to 50 levels, and in fact, a silly and modified version of that is currently up -- a very interesting class system, and challenging, oldschool style. Essentially we have an archive of over 27 years of versions of this mud-all which are radically different from each other. This particular version, as stated above, consists of your typical dikumud areas, along with some interesting higher level areas, and several attempts at humor hidden within these areas, and equipment within, added throughout the years.  It truly is fun, andthere usually is someone on willing to help newbies.  If you've ever played a traditional circlemud or dikumud, you'll be able to figure this out while enjoying it.  And remember -- this is the longest running DikuMUD EVER. There's a reason for that: it was always at either judy.indstate.edu 2150, henry.indstate.edu, fred.indstate.edu, laurel, and ramsey.indstate.edu, and now it is on laurel.indstate.edu 2150, so unfortunately we've lost a lost of players. However you're welcome to come! There is always someone on wanting to give you the secrets of the game, and help you out! This post was put up in the hopes that the old players will have the opportunity to find these versions, should they try to search, but ultimately, everyone is welcome! Cheers!</desc>

    <desc>Set in the Star Wars universe this MUD takes place shortly after the New Jedi Order series of books. The Imperial Remnant was reorganized into the Imperial Dynasty by Empress Talia Oliska-Matsumoto and the galaxy experienced a peace between the Dynasty and the Republic. However, that peace was destroyed when the Sith Empire arose and gutted the Republic nearly overnight. Joining together the Galactic Alliance has been formed from the ashes of the Republic and the defense of the Dynasty. Meanwhile, the Jedi Order has also suffered many losses as the new Sith Empire has driven them almost to the point of extinction.</desc>
    <desc>The MUD hosts Immortals that don't carry around a lot of drama and will always enforce their rules fairly. Roleplaying is highly encouraged and there are many immortal run Quests for the players to participate in. Currently the MUD is working on adding new planets for you to explore and experience.</desc>
    <desc>We hope to see you soon.</desc>

    <desc>In 1747 the second school of magic in America was founded in Silverdale, Pennsylvania, outside of a young Philadelphia. The school was named Scattergood school of the Magical Arts, reflecting the Quaker influence of the Eastern Pennsylvania area.</desc>
    <desc>Scattergood was founded by graduates of the famed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland. The five founders of Scattergood wished to share their love of knowledge and education by assuring that magical families in the Pennsylvania area would have a safe, welcoming place for their children to learn the prestegious art of magic.</desc>
    <desc>The town of Silverdale is an all-wizard community about 30 miles west of Philadelphia. Located in the hills, Silverdale is far enough from Philadelphia to be considered rural, but close enough to the city to allow residents to enjoy the conveniences of the city.</desc>
    <desc>Silverdale was founded in 1703 by Wizards and Witches who wished to get away from Muggle settlements and practice magic away from prying eyes, motivated mostly by the International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Now, in the year 1950, Silverdale is home to about 1500 residents and its economy blossoms for nine months out of the year while school is in session at nearby Scattergood and students pour money into the local economy.</desc>
    <desc>Players take on the roles of students, staff, and townfolk in this roleplay based game. All character actions are roleplayed. We have no coded spells, levels, battles, etc.</desc>

Some areas are still under construction and builders are always welcome. Characters which do not require administrative approval to start include hobbits, elves, orcs, and humans. Other types of characters are also available on a limited basis. OneRing is still a very small MUSH, so there are not always players connected at any given time.

    <desc>New Worlds Ateraan is a full featured Intensive Roleplaying Game. Offering several unique and powerful guilds, races, politics, religion, justice, economy, and a storyline that is dominately player controlled with a history and background based on a novel for more robust roleplay direction.</desc>
    <desc>The Guilds range from your standard Fighter and Mage to the strange Retter and unique Merchant which is widely accepted as an enhanced roleplaying Guild with exciting features like guard hiring caravans, ship building and repair, clan building, house builing, auction houses, theater control, and reparations of weapons and armour.</desc>
    <desc>Religion is a topic of large debate and conflict, but definately not the only one. With racial cities and two distinct nations of varying loyalty and politics, Ateraan abounds in opportunities for the new immigrant and the long time established player. Social standing can be as important as strength of arms and starting in New Worlds is simple and direct with staff members, guides and experience players to assist you.</desc>
    <desc>Murder and intrique can find you in dark alleys or on a highway, or you can seek gold and fame with groups ranging in size to solo or twenty or more adventurers raiding a stronghold, or you can relax on an open beach while fishing, digging for clams, finding crabs, or swimming in shark infested waters.</desc>
    <desc>The diversity of roleplay and adventure in New Worlds is astounding as you will find yourself aligned with a faith or clan, race or guild, or on a romantic get away to an inn or resturaunt with intelligent servers, or perhaps smoking gnome pipes while watching a theatrical performance in a fully operational and player run grand theater. And the serious roleplay only matches the hundreds of weapons, armours, creaturs, artifacts, and items of power.</desc>
    <desc>A newest feature is the massive shipyards that boast several unique styles of ships from the tiny two man dingy to the sleek and fast cutter, to the huge fifteen crew and multiple room yacht, to the fortress of the sea war galleon that boasts over nine distinct and seperate weapons.</desc>
    <desc>Our ships and seas offer exciting quests, deep sea fishing, cargo caravan runs from various ports, pirate hoves and enemy ships, the ability to board and sink opposing ships, go on whaling runs, and battle other players at sea, even to the point of massive armada combat.</desc>
    <desc>All we ask of our roleplay focused playerbase is that you remain in character while in the game. While there are out of character areas, the game thrives and demands strict roleplaying, giving New Worlds the magic of a well written, yet unscripted story.</desc>
    <desc>What most have said about New Worlds, \"Play it for a week, and show your style of roleplay, and we guarantee you will find a home here.\" We have a player base that is 50/50 ratio of men and women, and a wide age range, so all will find their nitch.</desc>

    <desc>DoomMUD has returned once again.  We are very excited about the many changes we have brought to the game. We have retained the old multiclassing system however we have added a few twists, including a detailed remort system with over 10 remort only classes to choose from.  Aswell we have designed a unique trade system, choose to become an armorsmith, a weaponsmith or even an alchemist.  Use your knowledge to raid keeps, gaining the ability to take control of a keep for your clan.  We have implemented a huge clan system which includes many titled ranks for members, huge clan compounds, clan treasuries and many other unique features.  The newest change that we are very excited about is our own unique mobile trigger system which has been implemented alongside an 'active quest' system. Take part in huge quest arcs that make it seem as though the creatures are interacting with you just as much as you are with them.</desc>
    <desc>Whether you are an old veteran or a new player to DoomMUD, come out and have a good time, we are always looking for new faces.</desc>

    <desc>Denver is now THE most popular Shadowrun MUSH on the Internet. A quick thanks to all the players who are making this possible is in order.</desc>
    <desc>Shadowrun - Denver is oriented towards players who have had some experience in RPing in Shadowrun, whether online or in TT play. It has a very friendly, open atmosphere between players and staff, and is intended for people to have fun, not model a 'realistic' Shadowrun world. To apply, connect to the MUSH, read the application policy, and follow the instructions there.</desc>
    <desc>Our chargen has often been said to have the best code of any of the Shadowrun MUSHs. You can create anything from a gun-toting Street Samurai to a Rogue Doctor plying the shadows to help who he can and make a profit. We are currently using SR3, Magic in the Shadows, the Cannon Companion, Man and Machine, the Matrix, some portions of Rigger 3, and State of the Art. All character types are welcome, with no slot restrictions.</desc>

    <desc>Star Dart alpha is an engrossing Java-based combat mud, where your only quest is to surpass the other players and achieve galactic domination.</desc>
    <desc>Star Dart alpha became stable in January 2002, and new features are still being added on a daily basis. We encourage players to interact with the development team in-game and in our forums, and this interaction is frequently the basis of upgrades to the game.</desc>
    <desc>Unique to Star Dart alpha is the concept of a periodic reset of the universe; depending on the arena, the universe may revert to it's unaltered original form at some interval between a few hours and a week, depending on how the admins have set up the arena. This way players can chose their their level of committment to the game (since playing Star Dart alpha is generally an intense experience).</desc>

Lewis in the 7-book series, _The Chronicles of Narnia_. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- The year is Narnian 1006, just six Narnian years after the fall of the White Witch from the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.  The Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve sit on the thrones at Cair Paravel, and Narnia is enjoying the beginning of what will later be known as its Golden Age.  But all is not completely well.  The Witch's evil minions still lurk in the shadows of Narnia and its borderlands, plotting both to avenge their mistress and recover the land they now believe is rightfully theirs.  The Royalty has made it their business to eradicate them altogether, but it's difficult.  Evils are sneaky.  Moreover, the savage Giants of Ettinsmoor are restless, and they're constantly bickering and warring with each other.  The fallout of these battles sometimes falls across the borders, so Narnia stands to need to do something about them soon. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</desc>

    <desc>Allandria is a 100% from scratch code base that plays similar to Diku, but offers a number of surprises. The code is largely modeled after D&amp;D 2nd edition rules, and is one of the more faithful conversions (although some fudging was done in terms of what plays well on a MUD). The dungeon is randomly generated like Diablo, and is setup to regenerate anew when the goal of killing the final boss is achieved.  More notable features include:</desc>
    <desc>* monsters that group and cooperate in and out of combat * persistant bosses * run time random treasure on monsters that use eq * monsters make full use of spells/magic items * inititive based combat that does not always resolve all in one pass. * true multi classing for non-humans as per AD&amp;D 2E * true dual classing for humans (mostly) as in AD&amp;D 2E</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to a MUD where the code around you is constantly trying to improve itself to become one of the best out there. It's setting is fantasy-medieval. We have 91 levels of playing with an incremental experience leveling system. Immortal, Vassago's, and Thri's Quest code. For those who don't know, Vassago's quest code is a go here get this or kill this mob.  Thri's quest code is a mob driven code where you do a task for that given mob that has one for you. All area's are original, but still use an easy to follow map layout to make joining here more pleasant and easier to find your way around. Many thanks to my builders for helping to continually grow the world around us. Offers Newbie help when the Immortals are online, and Newbie school is very helpful to new MUDders. We offer a clan system. We offer a unique worshipping system. We have an automapper system. All spells/skills are given upon creation, and are being driven to be more specific by the users choices. Currently Warriors are asked to choose a weapon to specialize in. Later other classes will follow a specialization. Colourful, not a one colour mud. All builders are welcome. Roleplaying is encouraged, but not enforced. For those who always think they have a better way, or a great idea for a mud, I don't just throw them into the wind. All player idea's are seriously thought upon, and if it's within my coding capabilities and I like it, I give it a shot.</desc>

    <desc>Dark City was the follow on to the original GodWars MUD created by KaVir.  Whereas GW featured Vampires, Werwolves, Demons and Mages, Dark City only featured two of those classes, Vampires and Werewolves, which were both totally recoded making them more World of Darkness like.  Dark City was also the basis for the GodWars Deluxe code release.</desc>
    <desc>Way back in 2000, i was given permission to run Dark City. Our aim then, as it is now was to bring the BEST of Dark City back to life.</desc>
    <desc>Dark City has a wilderness where you can mine, fish, chop down trees to build houses, lay roads and much much more.</desc>
    <desc>Our Vampires and Werewolves are as close as they can be to WoD Vampires and Werewolves in a PK setting.</desc>
    <desc>If you have played this MUD since 2000, you will find that your player files are still there.</desc>

    <desc>DragonBall Finally Born is an evolving MUD based around the DB theme not limited to it. DBFB currently has several races, several planets 13,000 rooms to explore. We have unique skills and transformations for all the races to make them a different experience. Each race has their own recall and planet to call their home. None of the races are the same and they all have their pros and cons.</desc>
    <desc>We have a vast amount of equipment sets and weapons to pick from. All sorts of items can be found from killing MOBs and completing different quests spread around the universe. Some items can be created by blacksmiths or tempered(upgraded) for a price. Also, clans receive badges, scouters and food/drink items that can be bought in their clan shop. To help sort all the items you may have, our inventory system has been broken up into 4 categories for easier viewing.</desc>
    <desc>Each race has unique powerlevel and ki from their bonus and level gains. Some transformations give new skills or upgrade one of your skills to do more damage and knockdown the MOB. Grouping is encouraged when leveling and players who group can receive a group experience bonus. Also, our spar system allows you to focus on either powerlevel or ki when sparring.</desc>
    <desc>DBFB has 12 PK zones with more to come in the future. Bloodlust has been coded in so that players with this flag can PK each other at anytime. Bounties are very popular in DBFB and usually have very good rewards. PKing can cause you to lose some stats if you are killed, so be warned. We also have PK Wars for the top PKers to test their skills.</desc>
    <desc>We currently have over 30 mini quests ranging from basic newbie to hours of grouping to achieve one goal. Solo quests are another type of quest where only one person can complete it and be rewarded from it. Recently a custom Questmaster system was coded in that has 6 difficulties, which puts DBFB's quest total over 50.</desc>
    <desc>Some other unique features in DBFB is our pet system that allows you to train them to fight other pets or to help you in battle. Our scouters have a special set of channels (frequencies) where you can talk in private or with a group of people like your clan. Space travel was recoded to make the travel times more random and allow the players to converse while in the ship.</desc>
    <desc>We have many more projects and zones to come in the future. DBFB is the evolution of the DB theme and will continue evolving as time goes by. So if you would like to see the DBFB  of the is a new mud. DBFB is newcome play  , come check us out!</desc>

    <desc>Nightmist Online is a Partially Text-based MuD ( Multi-User Dungeon). That is to say, there are many players from around the world at the same time interacting together. You begin by generating your own character, with strengths and weaknesses which are individual to you. You choose your class, and your race. Next you are put into a medieval world, where there are monsters, and players, shops, taverns, guilds, and all sorts of other things. What will you do? Perhaps you will seek out the legendary Gorgon Beast, and bring back some trophy? Or maybe you would prefer to become a thief, hiding and stealing gold off players and monsters. It is your choice, so choose wisely!</desc>
    <desc>The best way to experience this game is for you and some friends to download it, and play together. It can be a little confusing at first, but there is an ingame help section (activated by typing 'help' at any time). Remember, have fun!</desc>

    <desc>We have a decidedly silly and frivolous atmosphere and a â€œdo-it-yourselfâ€ spirit. Our main focus is quality over quantity. You can look at almost everything here, and youâ€™re encouraged to slow down, relax, enjoy the scenery and the small, cozy atmosphere. Silliness is always afoot in RagnarÃ¶k!</desc>
    <desc>The players and wizards here are a fun and friendly group, and we mean to keep it that way. You donâ€™t have to â€œconformâ€, but you do have to exercise good judgement. We wonâ€™t tolerate abusive or offensive players who clearly donâ€™t appreciate our goals and ideals. RagnarÃ¶k is a place where you check your â€œreal lifeâ€ at the door and come to a comfortable environment to be with friends.</desc>

    <desc>Intrigue Mux is an original, historical-influenced fantasy mux. It is a world of political, economic and social intrigue. The main part of the game is set in Adonica, Cambria and Bavell'sisstk, Niershindal. With the heavy weight of world economics and racial peace upon the shoulders of politicians and traders, it is a world filled with wonder and betrayal.</desc>
    <desc>There is much to be had within Adonica. The capital is filled with trade, low-level politics, the budding Academy, law enforcement, the criminal insane, and the gossip of the unfaithful. The intense trade and travel between Adonica and the open-minded Bavell'sisstk bring much to light. The opening Elven travel, the intense interference from the Dragon Halfs, and the strife between trade vs. raiding with the Badlands creates an interactive and boiling world. One should also not forget the exotic flavor of jousting, rare races, and magic.</desc>
    <desc>The World of Intrigue is a rich, highly developed world and theme. One meant to breathe life to the imagination and adept to the players within. So come all and one! To the World of Intrigue!</desc>

    <desc>Venture out into the 30,000+ rooms of the world as a Darkfriend or as one who walks in the Light, slaying your foes through outright combat, stealthy assassination, deadly poison, or powerful channeling.  If it is other adventurers you choose to hunt, you risk the complex country-based and noble-controlled law system and its fines and executions!  Or, choose the available pk flag option to force enemy adventurers to challenge you to combat.  If you wish, choose to not be involved in playerkilling at all.  It is completely up to you.</desc>
    <desc>Enjoy the flexibility of choosing whether to join our active group of roleplayers, and whether to associate with other people who share your interests, or be a lone wolf, spurning all.  Rise up to become a noble, controlling one of the kingdoms of Randland, or choose to be a commoner.  You might plot the overthrow of a hated kingdom...or to be a Blademaster in its service...</desc>
    <desc>We have an elegantly coded MUD, employing professional coders with 50+ combined years of MUD coding experience.  After six years of active improvement, we provide a very rich and mature play experience that is being improved on a daily basis to enhance your experience of WoT.</desc>
    <desc>Two of our most popular attractions are the extensive combat system and the unique channeling (magic) system.  The combat system is not boring, with combat messages indicating location of hits, parries, blocks, and utilizing various weapon skills. The channeling system is unique and original, designed to be as close to Jordan's One Power as possible while still being fun and playable. Other features include room-to-room ranged combat, a first-class mount system, multiple races, thematic and realistic professions, wolfbrothers, in-game AND web-based help files, balanced player interactions, and a thriving economy.</desc>

    <desc>Our game takes place in Great Britain, in a time when the wild things that lurked in the woods were powerful enough to fight against the Roman Empireâ€™s fiercest Legions, and the mysticism that centuries of generations later would look at with awe, was still a normal part of life. Simple lives are led, still, though the introduction of enemies has begun the inevitable change that all things eventually undergo.</desc>
    <desc>Celtic Britain has been the source of unusual magicks for centuries, the presence of the ancient Sidhe able to be felt all around. Tribe and family are oneâ€™s priority, and Rome his enemy. Love is deep, death is simply another door to be passed through, and honor is everything. Into this world steps the Roman Empire, with its organization, its blazing ideals and its unshakable conviction, governed by an Emperor whoâ€™s arm stretches across the known world.</desc>
    <desc>This world is heavily inspired by history, both in culture and in timeline, but it is important to understand that there are differences. Romeâ€™s victory is not yet assured, nor are things necessarily as they seem. The mythic is real, and the â€˜realâ€™ is possibly not such at all. There are differences between the peoples portrayed within the context of the game, and their real-life counterparts. While, as a team decision, we have chosen to stick closely to what research provides, some differences will be noted by those who study up extensively on the setting. We encourage you to browse our web site, forums, wiki and explore the game itself, to unravel the rich cultures detailed here: Although places like Wikipedia are filled to the brim with knowledge, brevity and playability necessitate that not all that WAS, in real life, IS, within our game.</desc>
    <desc>We are out of alpha testing now and are currently in our open, playable Beta. The game world is ever evolving and our code is being updated by our skilled team of coders as we work to make sure the game adapts to the needs and demands of our players.</desc>

    <desc>Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu had spread across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First, contact between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.</desc>
    <desc>It was the apocalypse.</desc>
    <desc>But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years, a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human worlds and back to where they came from.</desc>
    <desc>Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct. New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all, civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.</desc>
    <desc>You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species, and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.</desc>

The curved Bay Bridge shimmer like a ring on the finger of the harbor and in the distance, a tugboat guides a naval destroyer out to sea. Across the bridge, vacationers and college students dot the white beaches of Coronado, swimming and tanning. The 5 slashes the city in half like a grey scar. At the border, the freeway widens like a dammed river and the cars glitter in the sun; further south, Mexico is a realm of dust and rock.

    <desc>In the year After Colony 196, Zechs Marquise was succesful in dropping the Battleship: Libra onto Earth, and thereby turned the Earth into a baren wasteland.  However, White Fang's reign over space was short lived, as the remnants of the Earth Sphere Unified Nation reformed on M02 and independant colonies to oppose them.  Oz also reformed, seeming to oppose any order which was not there own.  The Maganac Core split off from the ESUN and created there own elite group of mercinaries.  Later on, the refugees from the destroyed Earth took to Mars in a massive terraforming project which brought about the creation of New Earth. Some of the cities from the old earth have been reconstructed there, and most of the old earths population have fled to it.  Those remaining on the old earth fell into different clans, and wage war for pitiful reasons on one another. And as for the Gundam Pilots, they all dissapeared into different parts of the galaxy, humiliated and beaten, never wanting to show themselves again.  The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, what will you do with the fate of mankind?</desc>
    <desc>This MUD is oriented around the anime series of Gundam Wing. We offer clans, a high level for training, a PK system which even works while in suits. Customizable suits, a targettable suit system. Many mini games, gambling. A building port for anyone who wants to build for the MUD, and much MUCH more. More will be added as time goes on, seeing as how we have plenty of ideas.</desc>

    <desc>Soviets detonate a set of 4 large nuclear warheads in a pattern 100,000 feet above the US, causing a massive electromagnetic pulse that cripples computers, electronics, and car ignitions across the country.</desc>
    <desc>Immediately after, NORAD detects a series of Soviet satellites deploying warheads. In thirty-six minutes, the war is over, with Europe and North America suffering from nuclear strikes.</desc>
    <desc>The series of warheads detonated with a combined force of 20 megatons of TNT. The explosion rips through NYC, flooding the subways with seawater and igniting Brooklyn. Making your way through the wreckage, when it is safe to escape, you face a new life in the Wastes.</desc>
    <desc>Many cities are razed by the nuclear attack.  The dusting of the Midwest and Central Plains by radioactive materials causes a famine that kills additional millions of people. Even after these catastrophes, a constant danger of radiation is present even for those far away from the blasts.</desc>
    <desc>As well as the human cost, the war left its mark on the economy and politics of the country. Due to the EMP burst, virtually all bank accounts, transactions, and other electronic assets simply vanish. Because of this, money undergoes a rapid deflation, with the cost of buying a home reduced to 800 gold dollars. In addition, electronic machinery and devices are rendered useless, which further limits the economy. Geopolitics as a whole has become an abandoned concept considering the cause of the War.</desc>

    <desc>\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....\" The events and players are very familiar, yet, things have changed.</desc>
    <desc>The galaxy had become an even darker place than during the rise of the Empire. Treacherously, Luke Skywalker fell to the Dark Side and joined his father, earning himself the title of Darth Fatalis. Together, this pair of villains not only destroyed the Rebel Alliance, but ended the reign of Emperor Palpatine as they banded together to kill him. This last fact was hidden from the Imperial troops and the Galaxy at large, until, the Hand of the Emperor, Mara Jade, brought the truth to life.</desc>
    <desc>In a shocking turn of events, the Empire was split into two factions. A new Galactic Civil War emerged, but this time, not as a battle of Good versus Evil, but something more sinister. However, Darth Sidious was prepared for the Skywalkers' treachery. Using Mara Jade's body, the Emperor had resurrected himself, and as he revealed himself once more to the Galaxy, led Jade's forces in a siege on Coruscant. Sparking the new Golden Age of Sith, he used his new Sith warriors to destroy the Skywalker traitors, and he personally revealed himself to the fallen pair of Jedi, before slaughtering them.</desc>
    <desc>With the Empire being once more brought under Palpatine's control, it seemed all hope was lost. Things have a tendency to come full circle; however. New rebellions emerged, led by surviving members of the former Rebel Alliance.</desc>
    <desc>Now, the Rebel Alliance has been reborn, though the Rebels have a great task ahead of them. The Empire is stronger than ever, but there is at last a glimmer of hope.</desc>
    <desc>This is the dark world of Star Wars: Uprising.</desc>
    <desc>* Play as almost any race and character concept your imagination can come up with (within reason), from nearly any race in the Star Wars universe, to pilot almost any ship in Star Wars, and mastery of the enigmatic Force can even be had!</desc>
    <desc>* Our unique stat system allows characters to start with a ship, money, weapons, and more, so your first day you are ready to accomplish epic roleplay.</desc>
    <desc>* A heavily expanded version of WEG's acclaimed D6 system; We use specializations, martial arts, cybernetics, advantages/disadvantages, and a robust, organic language code.</desc>

Befuddled by this unlikely covenant he racked his brain for some way to ensure that this would not come to fruition. The Drake continent would surely never be able to withstand an assault from both these races. His thoughts turned to the Evil One who had been banished so long ago. A shiver ran down his spine. Was Mordenaire even alive? Would unleashing the Pattern Reave be the Drake's salvation or their epitaph? Behemut needed time to ponder all these things. Time he didn't have. Time he needed to bolster his dwindling Drake population. The great one lifted his head and once again took slowly to the sky. For now he would continue to grant his gift to the few deserving heroes he could find. Perhaps if he could find enough of them, he could forget the Reave altogether.</desc>

    <desc>If you are tired of each 'new' MUD being the same as all the others, Geas is the mud for you. Geas is unique, not a standard mudlib. There are NO stock areas, no levels, no classes. There are no 'global shouts.'</desc>
    <desc>Geas features a 100% original world with a rich, detailed background. Races are truly different, in stats and appearances, in their history, traditions, and the reactions of other people. Geas boasts a fully formed pantheon of gods, each with their own aspects, powers, and relationships.</desc>
    <desc>In many MUDs, advancement is limited solely to monster killing. Not so in Geas, which features a realistic learning-by-doing skill system. Players improve the stats and skills they use - no fighting trolls to improve int. A player can focus on the fighting skills of a warrior, the sneakiness of a thief, or the craftsmanship of a master smith. Four kinds of guilds are available: professional, layman, race, and craft, and a player may join one of each type - or choose to go it alone.</desc>
    <desc>When it comes to fighting, Geas offers a realistic combat system, involving much more than just sitting back and watching hits scroll by. Players take an active part in fighting through a variety of specials. Armours are layered and crafted to protect specific body parts, while weapons have different capabilities, depending on weapon and armour type. Oftentimes in combat, strategy is the difference between life and death.</desc>
    <desc>The world of Geas has been more than three years in the making before being offered to the general public, and it is anything but static. It is growing and changing through a staff of active and knowledgable wizards, with help and ideas gladly accepted from players as well. To learn more, come in and try it out for yourself. A whole world is waiting for you.</desc>

    <desc>Fate of the Republic is one of the oldest running SWRs out there, just with a new face. Since 1997, the staff of FotR (Formally RitS) has worked hard to create a MUD that truly captures the essence of the Star Wars universe, a calling that most miss. Through advances in both our code, building and with the help of our loyal players and staff, I am proud to say that I believe we have done just that, shedding our SMAUG skin to become the first truly immersive Star Wars MUD, where the player steps out of our world and into the world of Jedi and Sith, where the Sith Empire dominates the landscape, having smashed the Republic and the Alliance that followed to their very foundations.</desc>
    <desc>Our code supports several key features that are unique to our MUD, including a brand new level system, a player-driven quest system and a completely unique profession-based level system that allows for quite a bit of customization. We have also recently finished an unique combat system that is slightly more than the usual 'whoever has the biggest blaster wins'.</desc>
    <desc>We've diverted from canon these past two years, and now we're playing out our own timeline. Palpatine died at the end of the Clone Wars, the CIS crushed the Republic under the leadership of a Sith Lord, who went on to establish the Sith Empire. From the ashes of the Republic a new Alliance of Free Planets sprung up, but after a long and drawn out fight they too were crushed under the heel of the mighty Empire. The appearance of the Yuuzhan Vong has severely sapped the Empire's resources, and though these unnatural invaders are all but defeated it has come at great cost to the Empire. In their weakened state many systems now question whether the Emperor is still fit to rule.</desc>

    <desc>Since the beginning of time there has existed a base struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil.  Until now.  Long ago, the land was dominated by two major immortal forces, one, the champion of good (whose name has been lost in the ages), and the Devil, champion of evil. Within their immortal hordes were angels, demons and all other forms of magical beings.  Eternally they warred, never winning, never losing.  Little did they realize that their true power lied in their mortal followers.  Neither of the two paid any attention to the mortal plane..allowing it to fall to chaos.  This only increased the power of the Devil, for as the land became more chaotic in nature, the true evil of man's heart became known.  By the time the champion of good had noticed this, it was too late.  His power had dwindled too much and there was little left he could do. Evil had won out and the Devil ruled the realms, both immortal and mortal.</desc>
    <desc>What followed can only be termed as hell.  The Devil turned the world into a torturous experience for mankind, forcing the masses to work and slave their lives away.  Whisperings of rebellion were heard throughout the mortal realm.  Gradually these whisperings grew into a roar.  The people of the realm were not looking to fight for good, but to fight against evil. It was rumored that the Devil had lost his immortality during the great battle with his nemesis.  It was the truth of this rumor that a group of powerful wizards were staking their lives on.  These wizards had been born and raised in magical seclusion.  No one knows their exact origins, only that they existed.  This group of wizards, known simply as the Seven, fought their way into the Devil's immense castle and there engaged a magnificent battle.  They gathered their collective energy and cast a suicide spell on the Devil, sending him and six of their members into oblivion.</desc>
    <desc>This magical cataclysm tore the world asunder, shattering any concept of time or space.  Everything was shifted and torn from their rightful places. The world left from this is a nexus, combining places and people from times and worlds beyond.  Into this realm stepped the only one of the ancient Seven to survive the grand battle with the Devil, Lady Alecca.  She vowed to try and restore what order they could in this new realm. She assumed the role of the gods and forged into this world left by the Devil's Silence.</desc>

    <desc>Dragonheart was originally opened in 1995 by a gentleman named Daniel Huber. He started with a basic Heaven 7 system and added all custom zones and gear. As the years went by, he continued to change the world and add new, exciting content.</desc>
    <desc>Within the past few years, Mr. Huber has followed his dreams and is currently teaching in China. The most current lib and driver were made available to a group of players who took the mud under control to keep it going. Since Mr. Huber's departure, several zones, gear, and quests were added to the game to make it even more fun. With content continuously being added, Dragonheart stays fresh, while maintaining the classic original Heaven 7 feel.</desc>
    <desc>The current Dragonheart is a heavily customized LP Mud with restricted pk, a 100 level cap, 4 classes, 10 races, special abilities per class/race, quests, etc.  It is a fully functional mud waiting for you to come by and give it a try. Several of the players, including the site operator, have been playing Dragonheart or coding on Dragonheart since its inception over 14 years ago.</desc>
    <desc>The mud is beautifully colored, with an extensive skill, spell, and level-based advancement system.  An active administration team ensures that the players' needs are always being taken care of.</desc>

    <desc>Revelation: Lands of Kaldana is a non-standard MUD because it cannot be played via telnet. Instead Revelation has its own client which can be downloaded from the website. The client offers a wide range of features which extend the game beyond that of text-only. This includes a World Map, and customisable Inventory, Button and Spell Icon pictures.  Please note that the client is only available to Windows.</desc>
    <desc>The game itself is not hard to play and easy to enjoy. It is set in the fantasy world of Kaldana and players can explore and fight their way through many areas across three different continents from the starting town of Myronmet. The playerbase while not extensive is very close knit and sociable.  This can make starting out a bit easier as all you need to do is ask any questions you have in Broadcast (the open chat channel). There are many quests which can be completed and vary depending on your chosen class as you level up through the game to a very open and extensive range of endgame group-based encounters or raids.</desc>
    <desc>The client can be downloaded from the homepage and a useful guide for new players can be found at http://www.kaldana.com/index.php?page=003 as well as the game’s own player-maintained Wiki database http://revelation.a.wiki-site.com/index.php/Main_Page</desc>

    <desc>Hallowed Realms, an ongoing project for a number of years has recently been revived.  The plans are to have it up and running from here on out.  There have been huge changes to the codebase. We started out on LP, decided to change to SMAUG and then restarted with ROM.  Yet we have retained the flavour of all our previous codebases.  The OLC has also been considerably modified, and uses auto-config tables for standardization.  A lot of effort has gone into balancing the game with regard to levels, races and classes. There are 100 mortal levels.  players start out as 1 of the 4 defaults. (war, mage, cleric, or thief).  Reclasses (specialization) are at levels 11, and 75.  Each reclass provides the character with a more finely tuned set of abilities. We are currently experimenting with a combat-less form of growth (leveling). Using crafts (such as woodwork, metal-smithing, and leather-crafting). As well as with alternative forms of magic [monks can chant, bards can sing, etc]. We feature all unique areas, questing, an arena, economy, and exponential EXP system.  Whilst the game is totally playable right now, we are looking to flesh it out a bit,with a crew of Builders, as well as PR and admin-type immortals.</desc>

    <desc>Many seasons have passed since everything changed. There are no more masters, no more lights, no more metal monsters, no more endless noise. The city and its constructs are quiet now. It is unlikely any being still lives who remembers 'Before'. Beyond the mountains is wasteland. Even with how much time has passed, peoples of all kinds still make their way to our haven. All are welcome here, though it is left to them to govern their own tribes. We keep to the dark places. We remain hidden. It is better that way. Cities are overgrown, buildings are crumbling. Cars were left to rust on pavement collapsing into sewers below. Wilderness is reclaiming civilization. Animals moved into places previously occupied by humans, thriving - or perishing - in their masters' absence. Creatures have adapted to their new, strange habitat Zoo animals were freed. Some died, unable to care for themselves, but many survived and have formed their own tribes (herds, packs, etc). After...MUCK is a 'talking animal' wildlife role-play MUCK set in a fictional world after the mysterious disappearance of humanity. Approximately 50-70 years have passed since the cities were abandoned and left to the ravages of nature. Our setting is roughly based on a Northern California/Northwest US environment, but it is not a specific real-world location. RP on the MUCK will focus on the animals and their interactions and lives in this post-human world with its new species with which to contend and all of its hazards. Time on the MUCK passes naturally, one IC day = one RL day, as such, seasons and time of day are roughly synched with real life west coast North America. Please note that Nature is a cruel, cruel mistress. Life is hard, and the RP on the MUCK is likely to involve MATURE themes. Strong language, violence, death, injury and possibly sex.</desc>

    <desc>The Lands of Evermore is a medium-sized but richly detailed fantasy MUD. Forget about stock areas, player hostility, and endless XP mills! A classical choice of races and classes, each with unique features of its own, will appeal to D&amp;D fans. Every room is a hand tailored, one-of-a-kind thrill involving prizes, secret passages, or well-hidden monsters. A thoroughly unique advancement system suggests a flexible choice of game styles, equally rewarding intrepid explorers, attentive questers, and diehard killing machines. Religion, economy and languages are developed into arts of their own, and a variety of crafts are offered to those of less violent inclination. The number of advanced features - like an automated minimap - is growing weekly. In absence of PK, all players are friendly and cooperative. Newbies can easily navigate around using interactive maps posted on the website. And a special bonus: Lands of Evermore runs on a decicated server and uses port 23, open by most office firewalls.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome mortal... or something like that. Honestly, I don't remember what I said before, so here goes again.</desc>
    <desc>Basically, Dark Lair is a modified Godwars mud, with the focus on more facets of player interaction, rather than just the standards fatality counter. While PK is allowed, there should be reasons for it.</desc>
    <desc>Classes currently available are Garou, Vampire, Ghoul, Mages, and mortals. To be classed, kill at least 5 mobs, look through the helpfiles on classing and the various bits useful to your chosen class, and then check for an immortal to set your class, or use the selfclass to set yourself as a Vampire or Garou.</desc>
    <desc>Garou are done. Level 1-5 gifts completed for all breeds, auspices, and tribes. Do think about which of each you want before you get classed. As per in actual WoD, gifts are limited by your rank, so it will take you a few days before you'll actually be able to use them...</desc>
    <desc>Vampires and Ghouls are done. Ghouls use the proper limits, which means that except for RP and as a sort of training level, you're probably going to hate their power levels. Vampire disciplines generally have powers from levels 1-5, except for some that go up to 10, and a few which either don't have any powers or only a few... These are noted during classing, which is one of the reasons for the classing system.</desc>
    <desc>Mages aren't as... unbalanced as most Godwars players are used to. It's an odd blend of custom and standard, which will take most players several weeks to months before they can actually chant anything except rune spells. Additionally, with Mages, you are expected to know enough about them to know which tradition or what you're asking to join. If you don't even know that, you will NOT be classed as a Mage.</desc>

    <port>1901</port>
    <www>http://www.thedragonball.net</www>
    <desc>The Dragonball is a customized Dragonball Z MUD that is not based upon any current DBZ codebase. This MUD provides a very unique experience that is true to how a MUD should play. Other DBZ MUDs allow a new character to reach godlike status very quickly, but advancement is more controlled in The Dragonball.</desc>
    <desc>Transformations are achieved through a unique system. Fighting builds your character's rage, and rage must be 'focused' in battle for the transformation to occur. Gaining each transformation is not a trivial task and will be something to be proud of once acheived.  Also unique to The Dragonball is a strength maintenance system. Your character can workout and gravity train to increase its muscle mass and gravity adaptation, which increses your STR. If your character does not train regularly, its muscle mass slowly depletes and your STR is affected.</desc>
    <desc>Playable races include Saiyans, Icers, Mutants, Halfbreeds, Demons, Androids, and Bio-androids. Currently, Androids and Bio-androids cannot be created but a feature in development will allow any character to be transformed into a Bio-android or Android.</desc>
    <desc>The Dragonball is a very friendly place and newbies are welcomed. RP is encouraged and occasionally an RP quest for the Dragonballs grants a lucky player a wish. The MUD is under constant development and new features are being added often.  If you are looking for a challenging DBZ experience that doesn't hand a godlike character to you with little work, The Dragonball is an excellent MUD to play.</desc>

    <desc>\"You got smarts, seekin' me out, kid,\" grunts the villainous-looking soldier before you. He is unshaven and grubby, approaching middle age, but looks fit and vaguely menacing. His stained and worn black uniform bears the insignia of a captain.</desc>
    <desc>\"As it so happens, I kin use folks like you,\" the soldier continues. \"I know you want to tell me all about what you kin do, but it dun really matter to me. Soldier, mage, priest or assassin, I kin use all types. We got places for tradesmen who dun wanna fight at all.\"</desc>
    <desc>\"Now them necromancer folks...\" the soldier shudders for a moment, then continues, \"...they scare me a bit with all the undead following them about. Nothin' against them, but they be worrisome.\"</desc>
    <desc>The soldier scratches the stubble on his chin thoughtfully. \"I reckon I should tell you a few things to give you an idea of what to expect. We're at war, and folks like you are gonna determine how this plays out. So listen up, kid!\"</desc>
    <desc>ROLEPLAY. \"Some folks is jest killers by nature.\" The soldier pauses for a moment, as if remembering a happy thought. \"If that's you, I ain't got no problem with that. Jest remember, I expect you to act true to yer nature while yer with us. If'n you feels the need to go hunting and killing other folks like yerself, you best be able to show that you're just being true to yer nature, and that you has good reason ta be doing such.\"</desc>
    <desc>CRAFTING. \"Everyone kin and should learn something about crafting.\" With a sharp knife, the soldier whittles idly on a piece of bone as he speaks. \"Some folks canna stomach killing at all. That's all right. If yer an Artisan, you kin do just fine getting materials and building stuff, right from the start. Artisans makes the best equipment that can be used, and folks likes them.\"</desc>
    <desc>CLANS. \"It kin be tough ta get by on yer own.\" The soldier make a half-hearted attempt to straighten out his threadbare uniform, but loses interest quickly. \"Depending on how you see things, you kin hook up with other like-minded folks and form yer own clan. Mebbe yer a religious type. Mebbe yer a military man, like myself. Mebbe yer even a thieving rat. Joining a clan, or forming one, gives you a safe place to catch yer breath and mates who will watch yer back. Mostly. Of course, whether yer in a clan or not, you kin always get yer own house and furnish it as you like.\"</desc>
    <desc>PLAYERS HELP SHAPE THE WORLD. \"It makes my head hurt ta think about it,\" grumbles the soldier, looking uneasy. \"But that's the way it is. Folks like you kin help, er, discover the history of the world. Discover lost kingdoms, that sort of thing. I hear we got good people working on that right now. Good people. Solid. But...\", the soldier points a grubby finger at you, \"It be folks like you that will determine what kind of place the world will be.\"</desc>
    <desc>With a rasping cough, the soldier spits an evil-looking glob of yellowish phlegm onto the floor with satisfaction. He turns back to you and raises an eyebrow. \"You still here? Whadda ya waiting for? Get out there, kid, and change the world!\" ___________________________________________________________________</desc>

    <desc>Seattle 2064 is a Shadowrun-based MUD. It was originally based on Circle code, but has evolved extensively. Currently, we're moving towards full SR 3rd edition compliance. Seattle 2064 supports all the major SR character types: deckers, riggers, shamen, mages, street samurai and physical adepts. We have a wide variety of both coded and roleplay-only abilities and skills as well. The MUD world is dynamic, detailed and constantly growing. There are a lot of areas to explore and roleplay in - including the Sea-Tac area, Portland and parts of the NAN new places are perpetually being added.</desc>
    <desc>Seattle 2064 is an RP-encouraged MUD, although most any in-game rewards are obtained via RP, and gives its players many ways to customize their characters and their items - whether via detailed description commands or the restring command. Though there are many autoquests available, we encourage and reward good roleplay - whether with karma, money or even special items/abilities. Both players and immortal quest staffers run all kinds of RP events, ranging from simple fights or short encounters to huge, world-changing epic runs.</desc>
    <desc>Seattle 2064 is a beta MUD, and much needs to be done to fill it out and bring it into full 3rd edition compliance. But it's a great place in a constant state of development, one which tries hard to stay true to SR 3rd-ed. in look, feel, game mechanics and spirit.</desc>

    <desc>The Eye of Heaven is in shadow. Deep within the tunnels of an interdimensional cyst, the ancient city of the Mote teems with the refugees and misfortunates from countless worlds. They have been trapped by the portals that lead down into the darkness, and their lives are commonly brief and cruelly ended.</desc>
    <desc>But not all are meant for victimhood at the hands of slavers or savage tribesmen. Some have a spark of promise beyond common measure, and the boldness and strength of will to make a better life in the darkness of the Mote. Some are trapped castaways or refugees from other worlds. Others are natives of the Mote with an uncommon drive.</desc>
    <desc>Players take the roles of these exceptional figures, each seeking to make what life they would in the shadows of the tunnels. Whether seeking wealth and glory in the ruins and hidden lairs that surround the Mote, simply trying to survive their neighbors, or even venturing to find a way to escape the House of the Eye, their lives promise to be interesting- if perhaps short.</desc>
    <desc>Interested players can even arrange to run their own campaigns set in the worlds that lead to the Mote. A vast selection of classes and races are permitted for play, and within the scope of your own campaign you're welcome to set your own game rules. The game uses the Open Gaming License provided by Wizards of the Coast, and we gladly invite others to come join the fun.</desc>

    <desc>Currently we are seeing 20-50 players online, and recent statistics are available on our webpage.</desc>
    <desc>We feature 13 primary (alpha) guilds and approximately 100 additional guilds for later advancement, and multiclassing. With 27 races to choose from, the possibilities are nearly endless.</desc>
    <desc>Islands of Myth has a rich newbie-friendly environment that includes 16 different areas easily available from a single location, events specifically driven for newbies (players level 15 or under) as well as several other bonus features.</desc>
    <desc>For the higher level player we offers endless advancement and expansion of the player. The reincarnation system allows you to retain 80-100% of your character's total experience and build your character again, beginning with race and class selection. This allows high level players to experiment with different guilds, combinations, and 'builds'. There is also an option to split your single body into two or more, retaining benefits like access to your castle and equipment, but letting you play several different builds more freely.</desc>

    <desc>Our theme is simple; It's the Marvel Universe. No peanut butter in my chocolate or chocolate in my peanut butter (multiverse). No strange staff character centric version, no year one, no gender bending, no sandboxing. Just the Marvel Universe. Pure and simple.</desc>
    <desc>It all started with that fateful flight of Marvel's first family, the Fantastic Four. Then the tale exploded with countless adventures of thousands of characters. It's here, at Marvel Untold that you can expound upon those adventures. Essentially, writing your own and making those Untold stories come to life.</desc>
    <desc>Our cutoff is timeless. This isn't saying that we're a Year One, nor is it saying that we're current comics either. Essentially our cutoff is just before Inferno. The Golden Age of Marvel Comics when life was good and not so convoluted in story that a player cannot keep up with all that happened to the character in issue 367, page 8, panel 2. We also allow for current characters (if IC events have unfolded).</desc>
    <desc>With that said, character backgrounds are to be bullet-pointed. We do not want lengthy paragraphs. Character traits are necessary, but also brief in nature - Cover the key points and you're good to go. The staff at Marvel Untold want to make your online experience one that focuses on the RP'ability of the character, not the writeup.</desc>

    <desc>CaveMUSH is a mush in the grand tradition of social-building-coding mushes. The main body of the MUSH lay underground, but that need not limit its content to only subterrainian venues.  Links to the Modern, above-ground world do exist.  The story below ground deals with a race of small peoples known as 'Gnomes,' for lack of a better term, (they are different than the small, docile creatures of which you may have heard) and their struggle against an oppressive race of snake-men known as Syphians, who also live underground.  At this point in Gnomish history, contact with humanity is limited, with only a few humans knowing of the Gnomish world, but with most Gnomes knowing of the human world, but hiding because of their past together (ancient humans initially drove them underground).  As a human entering the Gnomish world, you will discover the Gnomes way of life, and perhaps help them win an epic struggle against the Syphians, their greatest foe.  Player building and coding is highly encouraged -- in any theme (floating areas acceptable).  There is no quota and no building limits.  Friendly people. The core's the limit!</desc>

    <desc>Dragonball - Path Of Destiny ------------------------------------------  Dragonball:Path of Destiny  is a Circle Codebase unlike most Dragonball Z muds. It does not increase PL gradually but by a boost system which is based off of 3 stats. Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom. Each stat increases the amount of Power, Ki, and Learning Points you get per boost.  Skills are learned by the learn command instead of the practice command. The way this works is you only have to learn a skill once for it to be 100% but how often it suceeds depends on your Ki Skill, Upper Body Skill or Lower Body Skill. Both UBS and LBS are entwined together so if you raise 1 in UBS you will lower 1 in LBS.  The features included in this mud are:  15 Races all from Dragonball/Dragonball Z/Dragonball GT Classless System Fishing System Extended and Unique Roleplaying System (Encouraged Use) - RP Characters - Saiyans and Majins restricted to RPer's. Over 13.5k Unique Rooms to the Mud (115 zones) Planets Include: - Earth - Vegeta - Namek - Konack - Frigid - Orainas Newbie Friendly Helpful Staff Immquests Newbie School Top Lists Limited PK System Transformations All Races have Unique Skills </desc>

    <desc>Play a part in the epic struggle of the Firan people against invading armies, meddling Gods, and the internal enemies that Fate has pit against them. Set in the capital city of Anarinuell, characters are a product of a rich heritage in which a divine wager and an historic marriage plunged the world into a war that has consumed three generations -- creating heroes, villains, and victims.  Characters also share in common a large and powerful city of residence; a charismatic leader; and a common enemy.  But Anarinuell is not a city about sameness, and roleplay focuses upon dramatic interactions among characters from different clans and different social strata with widely divergent religious and political views.</desc>
    <desc>Firan's coded systems are designed to exploit these differences -- allowing social, economic, and physical combat. Enhance your reputation in the community by earning social points.  Use those social points to spy, to call upon favors, to supress witnesses against you or to sabotage another person's reputation. Use your economic skills to negotiate better prices, or to deplete the city's supply of a given resource -- driving up the market, or instigating riots and strikes! In physical combat you can pummel a foe with your fists, or run him through with your sword.  You can even bring your assailant to justice with the legal system.

    <desc>The realm of Tirradyn has been an active and role-play intensive wonder of words for folks from every lifestyle to participate in shaping the society in a variety of ways since 2004. We offer over 65,000 rooms, roughly 350 areas, including over 25 inns and boasting an excess of 2000 shops. Our world is made of ten continents, four moons and another planet, with areas of interest located on all lands. Sea ships offer transportation between the continents where one can witness the dolphins swimming alongside as they travel.</desc>
    <desc>The unique role-play council of Immortals, along with active players often offers highly in-depth storylines for characters to get involved in, solve mysteries and be a part of molding the world, for better or worse.  A questing office can be found in many of the large cities for characters to gain employment and rewards of coin as well as unique objects for work performed.  Players can craft their own armor and weapons, tattoos, jewelry and containers! Our questing system allows for spell-boosted objects and custom pets.</desc>
    <desc>Many areas are classified as Empires. In these lands, characters are encouraged to get involved in the society and can climb the proverbial ladder, eventually claiming a title of respect or a reputation that might instill fear! Like dragons? Youâ€™ll love our NPC Dragon Council!</desc>
    <desc>A character can be a member of a guild and a religion. The religions reflect the roster of Gods and Goddesses of Tirradyn. Some members of the pantheon are highly visible and others prefer to keep a distance from the spotlight.  As may be expected, the differences in such a wide world can present rising angers and heated debates that often turn to physical outcomes. We have skilled players in the art of role-play-combat and anticipate the option of PK being implemented in the future for those more inclined to that manner of battle.</desc>
    <desc>Our players are dedicated in that they are repeat visitors. It is not common to meet a person in the IC world and not see them again for a week. It is easy to make a name for oneself, positively or negatively, depending on the style and preferences of the character/player. We appreciate and always consider ideas submitted by our players. We are proud of the fact that we have active nobles and a council for the player base. TG is home and a community that many of us spend the majority of our free time actively seeking to improve and enhance to an even better atmosphere. We welcome visitors to come and spend time with us and see if we may be the perfect place for your creativity.</desc>

    <desc>A relatively small, sedate building set away off to the side of the country road and bordered on one side by a lake, and on the other by an old growth forest. Pastoral. Picturesque. Quaint, even.  Without any real signposts or labels, the labs housed within are incredibly inconspicuous. Though inside, any number of experiments - illogical, unethical, and perverse to the eyes of nature - can be found walking around as if every day and commonplace. Through these labs, every little experiment that no one else wants to come within shouting distance of, whether for abundance of scruples or fear for more 'physical' concerns.  Yes, the Erotic Labs, home to the kinkiest research never before stumbled upon. Any number of roles are available for the medical lab staff, or for one of the experiments, or even for the in-house security or receptionists. Many options for adult roleplay abound, and all are welcome.  Come join at: mucks.homeip.net:6969 Pfizer doesn't have a -thing- on us.</desc>

    <desc>Imagine, if you will, that something DID happen at Midnight on January 1st, 2000. Your computer, and TV flickers slightly, and goes back to normal. You keep drinking, and figure it's nothing. The next morning, if you're one of the lucky ones, you wake up and pop some asprin, then go back to your normal life.</desc>
    <desc>If you're unlucky... something happened that night... You woke up and found that you were different somehow. Nothing changed physically, but you feel different.</desc>
    <desc>After a few days at work, you have an outburst. You can't take it anymore, your boss is riding you like a bull, or treating you like a slab of meat. You yell at him, scream, wave your arms around, and tell him you hope he dies. As you storm out of the building and get in your car, you turn to look at the building one last time. It colapses, and everyone in the building dies. This is the fate of the unlucky.</desc>
    <desc>It is later discovered that you can use powers, not unlike those of magical distinction. Only some people have had the reaction to the event. The unlucky were deemed: Magi.</desc>
    <desc>**** The events on Four Primes happen 20 years after Y2K. The Mage and scientist activists created an island that was supposed to be used as a refuge for the Magi, so they could be away from theprejudice brought on by the intollerant people in the 'main world'.</desc>
    <desc>Join us as one of the citizens on the island. Use your magical power to live your life on the island, make friends, and involve yourself in deep plots run by our wonderful Staff.</desc>
    <desc>Or</desc>
    <desc>Use your smarts and knowledge of science to create wonderful inventions to defend the island from intruders, or to help get to the bottom of a deep, and evil conspiracy.</desc>
    <desc>We run Plots with our players as often as we can. We staff do also have jobs, and home lives, but we do everything we can to make your stay at Four Primes an enjoyable one.</desc>

    <desc>Greetings Pkers, Well after thinking long and hard I have decided to host my own version of Godwars: Utopia.. We will not shut down we will not keep the mud closed for months at a time and changes will be implemented on a regular basis.. I know from past experiances how hard it was playing on previous utopia versions when nothing ever got changed, fixxed or improved. Currently the mud is up and open and looking for testers to help iron out the bugs and give ideas to what you the players would like to change add or anything else you can imagine. The server is paid for a year  so have no fear of us leaving anytime soon. We Offer. The features already in place make the game rich very fast paced and fun. So stop on by and let death rain down on your foes.</desc>

    <desc>Maddock is a small town in the territory of Montana, in the American West in the year 1880. Maddock has a wide variety of residents and visitors -- travelers headed farther west, cowboys, ranchers, miners, businessmen, gamblers, farmers, and even the occasional outlaw. The town supports commerce for the numerous ranches and farms in the area, as well as the gold, silver, and ore mines located across the river to the west.</desc>
    <desc>Maddock boasts an active group of long-time players who are always interested in drawing in new people. The game is a consensual-based roleplay system where staff and senior players are available to help. New players can develop an original character that suits what they would like to play and they will be offered assistance to weave them into the ongoing story and roleplay of this not-so-simple little town.</desc>

Currently we are only accepting Vampires of the Camarilla sect with limited Mortals, however that will change in the future. We believe very strongly in players having a lot of interaction with each other and making each person feel like a vital point in the story. Our StoryTeller staff holds to a golden rule and understands that WE are here to provide YOU, the player with an enjoyable place to play first and foremost. We have set in place some custom systems which we strongly believe will enhance the value of your time playing within our world, these include but are not limited to the Status-System and the Domain-System, which you can find more information about on our website!</desc>

    <desc>We have several race selections and 5 basic classes, many new critical attack skills have been added. This is not a complex mud with too many rules to learn, this is a simple system designed to mimic a live action game. If you are more interested in playing and having fun more than you are min/maxing or power leveling, I hope you'll stop by.</desc>

We've been around for nearly 15 years now, and still have that Old-MUD quality that many of the modern MUDs lack. QuarantineMUD has a tradition of providing an excellent MUD'ing environment, knowledgeable and helpful staff, and many hours of enjoyment as you explore our large and diverse world. We also support an elaborate clan system, and we host a dedicated staff of Questing Immortals, who strive to bring even more excitement into your MUD life. Role-Playing is encouraged, but not required. However, most of all, we strive to make your time here on Quarantine to be fun and enjoyable - because that's what MUD'ing is all about!</desc>

    <desc>The game is set mainly in the city of Vigil at the moment, but there is a lot more in the game than just one city (although very few people in-game actually know this as of yet). In the 2500s in Vigil, most technology has taken a mechanical-electronic route, combining the strengths of cybernetics and heavy machinery. The North and South sectors of Vigil are as divided and opposing as black and white, with North a filthy collapsing anarchic slum and South a shimmering arcology of law and order.</desc>
    <desc>At the moment I'm concentrating on polishing up and completing what I have: the North half of the city of Vigil (quite a large area), and a lot of basic working code for AI, combat, theft, shops, skills, player customisation &amp; advancement etc.</desc>

    <desc>The year is 2379.  Four years since the end of the Dominion War, which devastated a large portion of Starfleet's Fleet, and barely almost a year since the Romulans opened negotiations.  But there are still challenges to be faced, and as much as it looks like things are finally changing for the better there is always that chance that something unexpected may happen. Knowing this chance existed, in 2376 the Federation Council, based on the presentation of Starfleet Command, authorized the 'Redemption Project'.  Redemption-class starships were designed to be heavier variants of the Sovereign-class starships.  To start, Starfleet Corps of Engineers took the design of the Sovereign and expanded on it.  A new warp drive was commissioned to be built by venerable earth-based General Electric.  In addition, a whole new platform of equipment was to be designed for ship, with the hopes that she would become the most sophisticated ship of her kind.</desc>

    <desc>Star Trek: Darkness Within is a Star Trek-themed MUSH set in the mirror universe during the period between the Enterprise television show and the original series of Star Trek.  Since the majority of the details during this period (and in this timeline) are unknown, we follow canon as much as possible and have a unique history to fill in the many gaps.</desc>
    <desc>The year is 2199, and the Terran Empire rules the majority of space with an iron fist.  Having conquered most of the major powers, the Terran Empire's reach extends throughout the galaxy.  Laying siege to those who stand in their way, the Terran Empire is feared throughout the alpha and beta quadrants.  Within the last ten years, however, a growing force of resistance has become a thorn in the massive paw of the Terran Empire.  Battles between the Imperial Starfleet and the resistance dot the blackness of space with brief flashes of explosions and death.  Independent factions hope not to get involved, and resistance members try their hardest to rally support for the cause.</desc>
    <desc>With reports that the Empire has finally been able to reconstruct a Constitution class warship from the plans of the futuristic USS Defiant (NCC-1764), the resistance may have a tough time standing up to the firepower of this new threat.  Will you fight for the glory of the Terran Empire as an officer in the Imperial Starfleet?  Will you side with the rebellion and lead covert missions into enemy space to secure the freedom of your race?  Or will you be a wealthy merchant dealing in trade goods and secrets?  Without the light, there can be no shadow - only the darkness within.</desc>

    <desc>This mud is Alathon's Static Chaos (aka Chaosium). After cruising the mudding community over the past six months I was sadly disappointed with all of the player killing muds that I found and tried. They were all unbalanced and sadly unoriginal. There may have been minor deviations between each one...but no matter where you go it is your same old style of Vampires, Werewolves, Skyknights, blah blah blah. Thus it is with pride that I present to you a rebirth of an oldie but goodie. I spent the last couple week's bringing Alathon's code up to par with current environments and will be continuing development on the mud.</desc>
    <desc>Static Chaos was built by Alathon using Merc 2.2 as a base and it emulates the player killing environment of GodWars. Similarities are there but that's about all they are.</desc>
    <desc>There are 5 classes:</desc>
    <desc>Saiyan    - Masterful warriors using Ki Patryn    - Masters of Rune magic and mystic tattoos Sorcerer  - Mystic art masters wielding powerful Chants Fist      - Hand to Hand warriors using powerful combos Mazoku    - Shapeshifting astral beings</desc>
    <desc>PK ranges are set in a tier system that many of us are familiar with and lower Tiers are protected by a working Paradox system.</desc>
    <desc>There are many custom areas not found anywhere else. Need more destructive capability than you already possess? Then get a mobile suit and take down your enemies in a DeathScythe today!</desc>

    <desc>Millenia into the future, the Interstellar Human Empire had grown too populous to support all its subjects on the planets it held. The Empress Titania, faced with this crisis, decided to solve it by combining a mission of expansion and exploration with a dispersal of the human population across the stars.</desc>
    <desc>From Earth, hundreds of colony ships set out into the black, carrying millions of people among them to find new worlds to live on. Among these ships was the SS Starfall, a colony ship carrying little more than a thousand individuals, and led by the Houses Petakova and Stocklin.</desc>
    <desc>Over decades, the Starfall drifted through space, exploring star system after star system to no avail. In the end, however, they came across a planet with its single moon where they could live. The moon they called Pomona, the planet they called Voltumnus.</desc>
    <desc>Life on the planet was not easy, however. They soon found that all manner of terrible beasts lived there, wielding a force that could only be called magic. The creatures besieged their city, named for their Empress, and the more powerful of them decimated the colonists' ability to reach the sky again.</desc>
    <desc>The colony survived, however, and in time the same magic that the monsters wielded began to show up in Titania's citizens.</desc>
    <desc>---</desc>
    <desc>Seven hundred years have passed since the founding of the city. Petakova champions magic, and Stocklin champions science. Both aim for domination. Which side do you choose?</desc>

    <desc>The Builder Academy is foremost a training academy for anyone willing to learn or teach how to build a virtual World. Due to our success and the stagnation of the CircleMUD codebase we have also released our code for anyone desiring a stable and functional codebase.</desc>
    <desc>tbaMUD is the continued development of the codebase formerly known as CircleMUD. And we use it to mean both the Academy for training, and the codebase that is made freely available to the community.</desc>
    <desc>The most challenging aspect of running a mud is finding good builders. You will hear this from the admin of every MUD that has ever been. In the past it has always been up to each individual MUD to find and usually train their own builders. This works, but I think the MUDding community can come up with something better. That is why I created The Builder Academy.</desc>
    <desc>TBA has trained 1000's of builders and has an extensive tutorial and help file system. No pressure, no deadline, just come learn, teach, or help develop the tbaMUD codebase. Give back to the community we have all taken so much from. TBA is a MUDding resource. Take advantage of it so we can improve the entire MUDding community.</desc>
    <desc>TBA can also be used by other MUDs as a builder's port. Just send us your newbie builders. We will teach them and then you can have them back with the zones they built.</desc>
    <desc>We are always open to anyone willing to learn, teach, or help develop our newly released tbaMUD codebase (the codebase formerly known as CircleMUD).</desc>

    <desc>The theme has brought together the timelines of most of the Megaman games and melded it into one complete story. Four major factions fight for the fate of the world:</desc>
    <desc>Repliforce (Led by General, a group of reploids who serves the official defense force of the world), The Maverick Hunters (Led by Dr. Light and Rock (Megaman, X), an elite gathering of reploids that work outside of government regulations), The Mavericks (Led by Sigma, a group of reploids infected by the Maverick Virus, causing them to have an uncontrollable hate for mankind), and the Robot Masters (Led by Dr. Wily and Bass (Forte), a group of androids built by Dr. Wily, who is bent on world domination.). Along with these four factions, the fifth faction, the Civilians, consists of humans, androids, and reploids, with functions ranging from regular citizen, to Secretary-General of the UN, to a member of the Yakuza, to an elite Strider.</desc>
    <desc>We are always accepting applications and the entire staff will be happy to help you in any way possible.</desc>

We have rooms, monsters, objects, grouping, skills, damage and healing spells, ansi color, auto-mapping, shops, mailing, storage, banking, automated questing, training, 5 races and 7 classes. In contrary to most muds, monsters and objects don't have fixed stats, but the level determines the stats. This allows unique abilities like leveling up objects and monsters.</desc>
    <desc>Objects level up by simply wearing them and killing monsters equal in power, making them stronger in defense, attack and/or damage. They can load on monsters, in rooms and chests and can tweak or have many different attributes. Tweaking means the object is either slightly better of worse than normal, an iron sword +7 means is 7% better. Attributes load at random, for example a chance to pierce armor.</desc>
    <desc>On slow times, the mud switches servers and is run on promage.hopto.org 6000, while port 4000 is shutdown.</desc>

    <desc>Well, this is a new mud based in a medieval fantasy world. Coded from scratch yet trying to maintain familiarities of more popular code bases to lower the learning curve. The idea behind the mud is a world broken up into kingdoms and tribes. Player run governments extensive crafting and a world that is alive all make this game unique. At the moment we have just finished the base engine code and are adding content and features slowly but surely. That means that the game is not much of a game right now, but it is ready for input from players. The forums will be up soon for player input as to the current systems as the game grows. Please do not log on looking for a game to play. I am only posting this for people who enjoy bug testing and getting in on the ground floor of a project. Any questions can be sent to my email.</desc>

    <desc>It is a land of promise... a land of intrigue, guile, alliances and deceit. It is a land where wars are waged, diplomacy sought. It is a land of fantasy, of magic and myth.</desc>
    <desc>It is called Mythara... but it once was called Earth. Mankind ruined it, abandoned it, and after killing himself off, left it to heal itself. Mankind has been neither seen nor heard in more millennia than even the eldest of races can recall.</desc>
    <desc>Many would argue that this is a good thing.</desc>
    <desc>-----</desc>
    <desc>Welcome to Mythara: Remnants of a Shattered World! We are a semi-high fantasy MUX with a unique twist: the races you've come to know and love in fantasy fiction are shockingly different, our own legends mere shades of their reality. God-like beings walk the planet, and interact on a personal basis with its inhabitants. Mythological beasts roam the countryside unhindered... and the ancient technologies of the destroyer race, mankind, are not only forgotten, but also long gone to dust.</desc>
    <desc>Aside from the occasional political dispute, this world is practically idyllic. Then mankind had to show up again, and mess with everything. That was two years ago, with men and women from our own time, preserved through time by a magic they had no conception of, finding themselves in a world unlike their own. And, unlike the stories from their past, this time they had no fallen technology to reply upon.</desc>
    <desc>So, be a human, and help the struggling race climb from the ashes... or, if it suits your tastes more, play as one of eleven other player races in this dice-less, freeform role-play environment. The story is yours to write.</desc>
    <desc>Our game is currently open for playtest and chargen. Don't mind the dust, we're still moving in!</desc>

    <desc>The wizards confronted Torban about his actions, but he would not listen to their pleas. Torban soon disappeared from view all together, to wait upon a time when he would release the bonds he had placed on the mana sites.</desc>
    <desc>That was more than 500 years ago. Since that time, the races that had fled underground returned to the surface to find a world changed beyond all recognition. And recently people have discovered new ways to gain mana, and to work their way around the blocks between worlds with word controlled portals. A new age of magic is here.</desc>
    <desc>The population of Delsance returned to the surface to find their land all but destroyed by the furious wars. What had once been a magnificent land, had been reduced to little more than a desert. The only inhabitants of this area were the nomadic Delsan, the only race that did not seek shelter underground, with their caravans moving about scavenging the desert slowly of its remaining resources. It is in this desert that the great wizard Torban is rumoured to live, in the last of the ancient mana towers, which is protected by an oasis to confuse the wily explorers.</desc>
    <desc>The people dispersed, to seek new homes. Most moved to an area known as the Salyes Plains in the centre of the continent, whilst others returned to the underground, satisfied with their new home. These new kingdoms have flourished in the five centuries since the mana was blocked, and the way is open for bold young adventurers to seek fame and glory on the new frontier...</desc>

    <desc>A House Divided is a MUSH based on Vampire: The Masquerade. The setting is modern Los Angeles, a sprawling metropolis with over 15 million mortals and scores of undead who hunt them. Upon this canvass, our goal is to create the finest, most engaging and politically complex Vampire MUSH in the world.</desc>
    <desc>\"How are you different from the other White Wolf MUSHes on the net?\" *   We focus *only* on the setting of Vampire: the Masquerade; we don't even bother trying to fold in the other World of Darkness games. *   We have a streamlined role-play system designed to take advantage of the MUSH environment. Everything you need to play is available online. *   We have an extensive stat-locked lore system that provides ample surprises and mysteries for the most jaded of players. *   We support cooperative RP - a philosophy that draws on the maturity of the players to provide realistic and player-driven role-play. *   Any player can play a neonate level vampire; it's a Vampire MUSH. Ghouls and mortals are more freely available. Older vampires are application-only. *   Our focus is Camarilla society, with its politics and intrigue. While mortal society is present as a backdrop, our MUSH revolves around vampires.</desc>

    <desc>- Sectional Armor System. Yes, now you can wear iron gauntlets and a kevlar vest. Blow off body parts or just get knocked down.</desc>
    <desc>- Unique virtual weapon/equipment/medical/repair system. One command runs them all, and to use some of them you'd better have levels high enough to use them or...they don't work.</desc>
    <desc>- Skills! Yeah, we broke down and went with skills. As we go, we will be raising the number of skills. Right now we have 30 skills in play.</desc>
    <desc>- Our patented Furnace Crafting system. Don't like the choices of equipment on the game? Make your own!</desc>
    <desc>- Six species to choose from with four others currently App-only.</desc>

    <desc>We are new-player friendly as well as savvy in the wants and desires of extremely experienced players. Our Immortals are approachable and available to help you with your concerns and problems.</desc>
    <desc>We have already created MANY new areas (and our staff is constantly working at constructing new ones).

    <desc>Our Deity system is fully reworked and uses an extremely complicated variable system which gives our many Deities unique and diverse attributes.</desc>
    <desc>We are currently still in the design stages, but open to the public, so come and join a new MUD where your views, opinions and time can actually make a difference to shape the path of our MUD.</desc>
    <desc>We allow infinite character creations and currently allow up to 8 peaceful characters per player (ip) to play simultaneously so that you may help one character with others. Deadly (PKill or PVP) players are limited to ONE DEADLY character per ip logged at any one time.</desc>
    <desc>************************************************** We are currently looking for builders who have vision and GOOD knowledge of the spelling and grammar of the English language. (Sowwy ... We dunt wunna rewright all your aryas no madder how awesum yur dreems.)</desc>

He or she will be able to create areas within a bracketed level range and not ONLY be interested in building Multi-Avatar level areas.</desc>
    <desc>Applicants will be asked to level to level 20 in order to get to become familiar with our MUD and its staff and players somewhat as well as have time to check news, notes and help files. It does not take a lot of work to accomplish this.</desc>

    <desc>Forgotten Kingdoms is an RPI (Role-Play Intensive) game which is set in the Forgotten Realms multiverse. The game has over 250 unique areas and is still growing rapidly, thanks to a large team of builders who continuously update existing areas as well as adding new areas and challenges.</desc>
    <desc>New characters can choose from a huge range of races and subraces, including shield dwarves, moon elves, mountain orcs and even planetouched characters such as genasi, aasimar or tieflings. Once you have selected your characters race, you must choose a base class of Warrior, Wizard, Rogue or Priest, each of which offers a different roleplay experience, and can be further customised by joining one of almost 50 guilds. The last major decision to be made by any new character is to decide where they grew up - possibilities include several famous Forgotten Realms locations, including Waterdeep, Zhentil Keep, Menzoberranzan and Mithril Hall.</desc>
    <desc>Additional key or unique features of Forgotten Kingdoms include:</desc>
    <desc>1. A large range of feat trees and meta-magic feats, ranging from 'celestial bloodline' to 'crippling strike' through to 'spell-casting prodigy'.</desc>
    <desc>2. A unique 'spell memorisation' system based on system used in Dungeons and Dragons. This means no mana!</desc>
    <desc>3. Well over 300 spells to choose from.</desc>
    <desc>4. Many avenues for character development, including joining up with factions such as the Black Network or the Grey Hands, joining the inner circle or even becoming the high priest of one of 30 faiths...the possibilities are myriad!</desc>
    <desc>5. Close, but not slavish reproduction of Forgotten Realms lore - as a result of various wide-ranging plots and the actions of our players, our world has taken a different path to a different present...</desc>
    <desc>Forgotten Kingdom's greatest strength is its large population of superb role-players, who ensure that there are always several ongoing plots to be a part of.</desc>

    <desc>Neo Infinity will not be based just on Dragonball, I like other Animes also and have yet to see a good mud that uses multiple Animes, created on the Smaug Codebase, so I decided to make one. The only other one I know about was created by me almost three years ago and was stolen. I started this mud back when I was in Highschool like 6 years ago and never got to do anything with it. The Highschool Computers wouldn't allow me to do much back then.</desc>
    <desc>Let me start over, I am opening a very newbie friendly mud, I need a full staff pretty much, I am very picky about who I hire, but I do want a staff that at least knows what they are doing. I am willing to train anyone who wants to learn to build. I am not hiring coders at the moment. The entire mud is pretty much stock DBSaga areas, but I am trying to add on to them. I want to keep them as a Tribute to DBSaga.</desc>
    <desc>I encourage Roleplaying because I enjoy watching the crazy stuff some of the players come up with.</desc>
    <desc>Currently I will be porting over a few new Races that I have created on DBTFF before I had a mental block and quit working there. Fierians, Hylians and Reploids. Reploids, when they are installed, will not have much based on Abilities, but I will be trying to redo them so they play more like in the Megaman games. I am also open to creating more new races based on players Ideas, but that is an in mud issue once you have made yourself at home.</desc>

We have 6 base classes and if you do multiples using our remort system other classes become available. We also have a multiclassing system that isn't fully implemented meaning that if you wish to multiclass you need an immortal to allow you to do it. The clans are small right now and some need leaders. Clans also have elder positions available and imm positions known as essences available. If you feel you are a good rp'er and could bring some new rp ideas and life please log in and give us a try. If you have immortal experience feel free to log on and learn the mud from a mortals perspective and should you learn the mud well an essence position or other immortal position could be your calling. We have available quests that any can do once the minimum level is achieved. We have numerous races that are good at various things and a couple races specific to our mud.</desc>

Set on a world that was once whole, the Broken Sphere is now a broken world held together by powerful magic and some say - hope. Ashirion is the result of 6 years of work online and 23-4 years of work offline, from Wolf. Ashirion is a dark universe of danger and adventure, where the forces of light strive to battle the ever growing menace of a triad of despicable foes. The Shadoen, merciless and ruthless servants of the Shadow Lord. The Void, instruments of a mad God, and the Risen - Undead that think, and reason, footsoldiers in the endless twisted games these beings play.</desc>
    <desc>Many events have transpired on Ashirion since the beginning and they are part of the world's history now, heroes have come and gone...shaped the very essence of the Broken Sphere and still they strive to banish the darkness forever.</desc>

    <desc>Established in 1999, 'TNC' (formerly 'Stormy Nights') has a new owner and a new direction. The game focuses more on non-stop player-instigated role-play with staff assistance (and from time to time a staff-instigated role-playing session). A player-run newspaper (complete with reports, editors, newsrooms, bulletin boards, and, of course, newspapers) reports the activities of the players, including the player-run police department and organization that often conflicts with one of the player-run mafias. These run-ins often lead to player lawyers representing both sides in our realistic courtroom design with a concealed jury system.</desc>
    <desc>With new professions being enhanced for player-run role-playing all the time, 'the-night.com' is constantly improving itself. Currently featuring a real-time camera/film/theatre system, cars, houses, offices, postal system, phones, casino, three towns (two habitable), television system, auction system, player-run bars, airplanes, trains, musical instruments, accent system, identity-concealing masks, access to staff assistance, and more!</desc>

    <desc>Another Update!! We are opening an Old World of Darkness MUSH, based in Venice, Italy in the year 1252 AD (Chose because according to actual history and White Wolf history, this is the year that the Pope gave his blessing for the Inquisition to start using torture).  As we come closer and closer to beta testing the need for staff is becoming more and more prevalent. The focus of the game will fall on the Mortal/Mortal+ Spheres, Inquisitors  and Dark Ages Vampire (Revised). We are not yet open to players.  So, this post is ideally being made in the hopes of finding  the following: Coder Assistant-  While most of the games systems and what not  are installed and being tested , we will still appreciate and accept any help. Builders â€“ The main grid is still underway and being created as Venice is actually proving to be more difficult at building while still retaining some of the cities most important aspects.  Currently, we are seeking builders who enjoy creating the descs and what not as well any building help would be greatly appreciated. Storytellers â€“  HELP! Lolâ€¦.  Right now, we are currently seeking Storytellers who are willing to help get the RP and Spheres up and running. As with all other positions,  we are looking for reliable people to join the team. Right now, we are seeking  Storytellers to run the following spheres: Mortals,  Mortal+(Sorcerors, Numina, etc etc), Inquisitor and Vampire. f this sounds like something that appeals to you, please do not hesitate to log in, those who are interested in joining the team please contact Trentino and/or Veneto.</desc>

    <desc>Castle D'Image MUSH centers on an ancient enchanted castle that has stood shrouded in mystery for some six thousand years. This castle lies near the nexus of the lines of magical energy, the Dragon Lines,that run throughout the world. After hundreds of years of warlord rule, a strong line of rulers rose up to claim the castle for their own under the direction of Nicole Myris Taysinne Alian Rinarra D'Image and her consort Mikel. Queen Nicole D'Image founded a Dynasty that has so far lasted for five hundred years.</desc>
    <desc>The Castle D'Image and its neighboring city of Waes are at times peaceful and harmonious while at other times troubled by turbulence and violence. Its position at the center of all magic in the world has brought both prosperity and trouble from those who would seize its power for their own. Over the years the Castle has drawn a myriad of people to its heart. Royalty, nobles, ambassadors, knights, mages, scholars, adventurers, scoundrels, villains, and even simple folk have lived and died within its walls.</desc>
    <desc>The world of Castle D'Image is a world in which intrigue and romance, adventure and magic are commonplace. It is a land of possibilities, where almost anything an and does happen. For reference purposes, it can best be described as falling roughly into a late medieval - early renaissance timeframe.</desc>
    <desc>Applications are required for characters who are nonhuman, magical, and/or of noble birth. All other characters can be created and played immediately. The MUSH boasts 1-2 long term, MUSHwide TPs per year, usually running 1-2 RL months in length, with other player-run plots and day to day RP occuring in between.</desc>

    <desc>For some hundred years the inhabitants of the Nine Nations of Atleah have peered fearfully from their windows by the light of a molten moon. Tortured by the strains of war and a crushing empire, they have watched by that red light for the impending invasion of slavering demons, of foreign armies, of all the nightmares of war and the dark.</desc>
    <desc>In the midst of all this, the four gods who betrayed a now missing creator manipulate mankind and all else in the guise of mortals themselves. With a stranglehold on rebirth, where for every death there is but one life allowed to be be born, the four Sentinels have devised a way to purge the world of men and other innocents - and replace them with their own kind.</desc>

    <desc>With the conclusion of the Khitomer Accords, peace between the Klingon Empire and the United Federation of Planets is finally a reality. Citizens of both factions can finally look forward to an era in which they need no longer view their neighbours with suspicion and fear and the Klingon Neutral Zone is a historical relic. Only the militaristic elements in Starfleet are displeased, for they face dismantling the old Neutral Zone defenses and disposing of a sudden, vast amount of extra hardware and officers that have come into their hands.</desc>
    <desc>Luckily, the eye of Starfleet Command is always wandering, and with the Klingons friendly, they begin to look with concern at the Romulans. The space around the Romulan Neutral Zone is largely uncharted, and more than one science vessel sent in has not returned. At last, Starfleet can afford to explore in force, and an old dreadnought, the USS Federation, is rapidly recommissioned, crudely refit, and sent into the breach.</desc>
    <desc>But the operation is better optically than strategically. The Federation is forty years old, a ragged old ship that was never properly refit or upgraded and is held together with string, glue, and willpower. The officers and crew are largely a gang of youngsters, misfits, and hasbeens, sent off because they're the ones Starfleet can afford to lose. And the obstacles they will face will be as great as any that a starship has met before.</desc>
    <desc>Star Trek: Faded Glory is a Star Trek MUSH set two years after the events of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, on what was once the pride of Starfleet before most of the ship's crew were even born. Run as a project of the god of Corporate Expanse: From the Cradle, Faded Glory is meant to capture the atmosphere of an overstressed ship and an overstressed crew plunged in way over their heads.</desc>

    <desc>Raughir is dead, and the Last Rift War is over. With the death of its Demonic Emperor, the empire of Uruadum has disintegrated into civil war and chaos. But from the ashes of defeat, the ancient city of Tenigul has arisen and asserted its independence and dominance over the vast province of Akar.</desc>
    <desc>It has been a difficult path to independence, however. Enemies on all sides have beset the city and its province; old alliances have been broken and from them have come new enmities. The collossal Durnalian Empire to the Northeast, across the Kunyori Sea, has established trade with Tenigul, but there is often a grave mistrust for the Durnalians; they were bitter enemies in the Last Rift War. This is a delicate time for Tenigul, and its people. Many and varying Factions within the city and without it are at constant odds with each other, and at any moment an old rivalry may erupt into war. Such is the Kingdom of Akar. These are days when friendships are made and broken overnight; when personal gain is the primary loyalty of most men.</desc>
    <desc>So what will your role be here, traveller? Will you profit greatly here, or will you become the pawn of the powerful? Whom will you serve? Or will you serve yourself? The decision is yours, but beware whom you befriend. Not all is as it seems in the City of Tenigul.</desc>

    <desc>Fourteen (14) years of active development. Administered by professional software developers and published authors. This mud has a complex, detailed and sprawling world. This is a player-centric mud supported by innovative and interesting economic, legal and ecological systems.  Players run guilds, players operate stores, players set prices, and players build structures throughout the world.</desc>
    <desc>That said, it is a challenging mud. It's tough at the bottom as a newbie because this mud has unique and complicated game play; established players won't just roll over and give up their turf (or cash!).  Its also tough at the top with Lords and Guild Leaders responsible for administrative and legal decisions which maybe unpopular with lesser players. This encourages an active and participative society. If you take the time and effort to learn the mud you'll find it unique and engrossing. Many of our 'hard core' players have been active for over five years.</desc>
    <desc>There are many ways to 'play'; it's not a killfest, we strongly encourage role players and a responsible community. But it's also a tough simulation; so the traditional 'warrior' adventurer will find plenty to fulfill them. You'll find 9 innovative races, 11 guilds, 32 quests, like you've never seen before.  Tough adventuring, big fantasy world, friends and foes.  Take the time to know Shattered World and you'll be richly rewarded!</desc>

    <desc>Completely revised, Imperial has transformed into a world of continents, oceans and islands reaching its third incarnation, Imperial version 3.5  Imperial has been online for over 11 years and this newest version has been active for one year.  It is one of the most stable and diverse MUD's in the world, with over 200 original areas to explore and MANY original cities located on three enormous, completely original continents. Players work together to progress up to level 50, through 8 races and 4 base classes that branch off into 12 finishing classes, having a choice to become an immortal and help run the mud, or begin to work on honor ranks.  There are ten honor ranks and they provide long-term playability for the serious player taking up to one year to reach the final rank of Emperor.  Imperial has excellent newbie areas and an extensive help-file system for new players, while helpful immortals and ranked players take new players under their wing.  Imperial has a meta system to improve your characters statistics and an auction system to find just the right gear for him or her.  Dragons are often seen in the air above the capital city of Kial-Qwyn. Sometimes these are the famous Emperors and Empresses returning from a hard campaign, but sometimes it might be a marauding dragon from the near by dragon's lairs. If danger, fame, fortune might be your calling then come and join us.  Become part of the history that is Imperial.</desc>

    <desc>The beta server was made public in January 2010. There is a customised client for Android devices and the tutorial system is made for those devices. As an experienced mud player you should be alright with using the game regardless of this. There are over 4000 accounts created already and there are around 10 to 20 players online. This is because of the Android client. I am now announcing this server here to get more old-school MUD players in.</desc>

However, some survived...</desc>
    <desc>The Dryads managed to use their vast knowledge of magic to evade most of the evil forces and rebuild their homeland. The Dwarves returned to their roots, reconstructing their kingdom in the mountains of the east. The Elves suffered tragic losses, losing some of their magical abilities, but were able to evolve with their new surroundings to form a new bond with nature. The Humans survived, both good and evil.</desc>
    <desc>Other less civilized beings thrived easily, as they didn't participate nor were exposed to the violent war. The Yetis and Giants lived in their mountains and forests, their societies untouched. Evil felt no downfall. It was sheer luck along that the Elves were able to gain the upper hand and lock evil deep beyond the Alpinolae Mountains forever.</desc>
    <desc>Recently, something has been lurking in the shadows. The presence of darkness has become more frequent in the land beyond. Evil is trying to take back its reign... Though as it stands, the land is in a state of division.</desc>
    <desc>Divisent offers unique features and skills such as mining, fishing, and gathering herbs.  Our system offers skill and spell learning through exploration, not inherency.  One must spend their time exploring the realm to discover new skills and spells to learn.

    <desc>Currently it is 1936, and the setting is the XI International Brigade fighting in the Spanish Civil War : one of the hardest fought and bitterest wars of the 20th century, a war of atrocities and political genocide, and a military testing ground before the Second World War for the Russians, Italians and Germans whose Condor Legion so notoriously destroyed Guernica.</desc>
    <desc>In the past we have tackled World War 1, in the future we will move on to 'The Big One', World War 2.</desc>
    <desc>The combat code is fairly extensive, and offers such concepts as fighter pilots, tankers, riflemen, machine gunners, medical staff and more besides.  Warships are not currently coded but we do plan on at least one story arc involving a U-boat when we reach World War 2.</desc>

    <desc>The Road to Amber is a roleplaying MUSH based on Roger Zelazny's Amber novels. Set just after the end of _The Guns of Avalon_, the game is focused entirely on Amber and the Golden Circle. Our aim is to capture the spirit of Corwin's Chronicles, with its pulp feel, potent heroes, and epic intrigues.</desc>
    <desc>In October 2009, we began the second phase of our story, a tale shaped entirely by our players. The Pattern in Rebma has been destroyed, the exact cause unknown, but Moire has put a price on Caine's head following the resulting earthquake. The consequences of this form the thematic core of this episode. Adding to Amber's internal strife, with the Crown in the hands of a beleaguered Julian, and troubles in the Golden Circle, there are greater concerns. Corwin attempts to create his own realm at the edge of Chaos, claiming it is a bulwark against the Black Road, but those who have seen him claim that Corwin himself has been corrupted by the power of the Road. And Brand claims to have discovered a fourth Pattern, one of fire, with strange and improbable properties.</desc>
    <desc>We have four guiding principles:</desc>
    <desc>- All characters are awesome. - Conflict mandates choice, which leads to change, which creates story. - The currency of play is Things to Do, and Interesting Meaningful Things To Talk About. - Drama and play creation trumps realism.</desc>
    <desc>Our innovative RPG approach is inspired not only by the Amber Diceless RPG, but by a variety of story games, such as FATE, Everway, Polaris, and Ganakagok.</desc>
    <desc>We welcome first-time MUSHers. Character approval is easy, quick, and painless -- no lengthy applications to write, just come up with a concept and you're good to go. Player characters are on par with the characters in the novels, and their abilities can be entirely unique.</desc>
    <desc>We also welcome players without any familiarity with the Amber theme. Of late, people have been wandering out of the Forest of Arden, people without much if any memory of their past, or how they came to be in Amber. You can get an instant amnesiac and begin playing immediately, so you can learn the game both IC and OOC from scratch.</desc>

    <desc>Imagine a world where only a few students have found training and refuge at the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, and the Brotherhood is only just forming under Magneto. Where Jean Grey, and Scott Summers are embarking on young adulthood, learning to become teachers for the next generation of mutants that may find their way within the hallowed halls of the Institute. A world where Peter Parker has just been bitten by that radioactive spider. Where Captain America has only recently been unfrozen from the ice after more than fifty years...</desc>
    <desc>This is our world.</desc>
    <desc>One where mutants are not known publicly for the most part. The Xavier Institute for Higher Learning is known as a privately funded institution, and it is only now that Professor Charles Xavier is starting to go out and bring other young mutants into a safe place of learning where there is no discrimination.</desc>
    <desc>But he is not the only one recruiting.</desc>
    <desc>Magneto, Sebastian Shaw, Tony Stark, the government... all are trying to find ways to change the world around them for various reasons - money, power, racial superiority.</desc>
    <desc>It will be a difficult road for many, with multiple twists, turns, and unexpected ruts which will shake their resolve. There will be few havens, few shelters for those with extraordinary powers.</desc>
    <desc>And yet there is hope.</desc>
    <desc>Whispered in the shadows, a beacon which may guide many into the light, rumors about New York - that perhaps there they can find a meeting place, to find help and shelter among others of their own kind - no matter which decision they ultimately choose.</desc>

    <desc>Xaos is a gigantic framework that eagerly caters to both the casual and hardcore player.  Some of the highlights:</desc>
    <desc>35+ PC races to choose, each with a distinct culture &amp; region A defined limit of trains to pick from over 500 skills &amp; spells Two dozen Combat styles that each influence your char's melee Max hp/mana etc adjust dynamically as stats do, no lvling gear Earn hero points from levels and quests, spend to define your char Dynamic application of racial traits if you have such an ability 40+ crafting and enchanting abilities to make &amp; improve things Possible to be part of unlimited amount of clans at once, NPCs too A persistent world that saves all objects on ground vMap - The mud's vast outdoors is mapped in intuitive asci live Vast and automated arena system with over 150 NPC &amp; PC competitors Random item generator extremely popular for randomized loot Enormous world, over 400 live areas (160K vnums) Religions are deep, containing castes and unique traits etc Mighty hero-inclined areas designed for groups of high-end PCs</desc>
    <desc>Apart from all that its got a growing community of players and staff from around the world all working towards making the place interesting and fun.  Our two coders (Altair and Ragnar) work at a pretty constant rate to provide an influx of code changes and our builder staff led by Obscillesk strives to generate encompassing areas and expand the world's landscape with new places to explore, assault and conquer.  Also with everyone on the account system the out of character channel keeps the familiarity of that player regardless of which character they are using while still allowing them to mask the true owner of one if they wish.  Our forum is also linked directly to these accounts and as such most of our more formal OOC communication occurs within it.</desc>
    <desc>We joke that Xaos will always been in a perpetual Beta state but it boils down to the mud is constantly evolving on every front.  As it is right now Xaos is 160,000 lines of code and occupies 170MB of ram when running, comparing that to its roots which were 35K lines of code occupying 5MB of ram...its grown a lot and will keep doing so. Come join us, there is definitely something here for everyone.</desc>

It has its own share of crime and broken dreams, but there are also mothers who sing lullabies to their children. This is the world as it is...</desc>
    <desc>This is a world destined to change. No one expected that the meteor shower that came one summer would awaken something that had slumbered beneath the surface for many countless centuries. There was an explosion, one smoldering rock striking just beyond the city limits. The wave that followed was enough of a catalyst to jar the old gods from their eternal sleep. The world is in danger once more, and the powers long forgotten must reawaken to fight.</desc>

    <desc>..and as had been foretold, the Cataclysm occurred. It was not the end of the world as many had feared, but nothing would ever be the same again. Humans could no longer continue their blinkered existance. The old realities had been forever shattered and the dreams had been let loose in the land. Drawing on this new power, the Ancient Races re-appeared. No longer did they have to cloak their comings and goings. The very earth hummed with power and even the most sceptical had to acknowledge that the safe order of things was no more. Reactions varied: some embraced the old ways and magic returned to the lands, some retreated to sheltered enclaves and developed new and amazing technologies, some gained the stars, some lost their minds. It was a dangerous and chaotic world, but the rewards were great for those brave enough to embrace the dream. Elusive Dreams has been up and running for over 5 years now and has developed some unique and interesting features. Roleplaying is strongly encouraged by clans which are totally player created and run. If there isn't one to suit your tastes, then you can always start your own! 219 levels and 15 remorts gives you plenty of time to create some depth to your character. Come on by!</desc>

    <desc>Shattered by a war between creators of the highest ranks, the following tyranny of those who won has turned a living place into a cold and desolate void.</desc>
    <desc>The first exodus happened in 1993, when the 'Linzer' admins, led by Patience, departed to create a new world. They handed Holy Mission to the Archwizards who had chosen to stay, and the MUD prospered. Packed with quests, legendary monsters, and a wide selection of guilds, some of them hidden and very restricted, the world was highly populated, easily reaching the cap of 60 simultaneous players. The broad community, comprised of many nationalities and all walks of life, made Holy Mission a fun place be.</desc>
    <desc>Good things never last, though. The old administration drifted away, and new Archwizards took their place. However, there was one amongst their ranks who did all he could do to destroy what other wizards and players had created. Alongside his highly-promoted friends, he sat back and watched as the lands around him died. A fearsome battle was fought in the early months of 1999, and although Holy Mission fell, he retained his power. When no living thing crawled over the damned world anymore, even he moved on.</desc>
    <desc>Today a few fans are working on restoring the MUD to give old players the chance to return and remember, and to give new players the chance to see what a mud looked like back in 1991. Holy Mission is nothing compared to modern muds like Achaea or BatMud, but its an original with a out-of-the box village from 2.4.5 lib and Padrone's castle.</desc>
    <desc>We look forward to welcoming you to our godforsaken lands.</desc>

    <desc>Static Chaos - Still Alive</desc>
    <desc>Static Chaos, known in the past as Chaosium, is a God Wars style MUD built on a Merc codebase.  Creator, Alathon, used the idea of God Wars to create an unparalleled PvP experience that is both balanced and fun.</desc>
    <desc>The game's pace is slow at first, giving newbies an opportunity to adjust.  Also, stock areas are used to give newer players an idea of where to start.  Leveling up is difficult and does take time. Unlike some Dystopia muds, you actually have to put effort into maxxing out character attributes, and aquiring equipment.</desc>
    <desc>Playable classes are broken down by race.  Each race has its own defined class:</desc>
    <desc>Fist--Human warriors who harness the power of their spirit. Mazoku--Demonic astral being who feed on mortal emotions. Patryn--Demihuman masters of rune magic. Saiyan--A race of warriors with tremendous innate strength. Sorcerer--Human mystics who wield the three schools of magic.</desc>
    <desc>Race/class selection is limited, but only because balance is of the utmost importance.</desc>
    <desc>In addition to player-killing, players have one other duty: being social.  In addition to being an exciting PvP environment, it's important to converse with fellow players.  There are no filters in Static Chaos so players have the freedom (most of the time) to say and do as they please... this is a double-edged sword.  If you're easily offended, you might want to second guess entering. Otherwise, we'd love to have you.</desc>

    <desc>The Heartless have attacked the worlds of Final Fantasy, weakening the borders between the realms and opening portals between each world. In their search for the Princesses of Heart, they were relentless, utterly destroying some worlds while reducing others to scorched wastelands. But some-- no, many-- people resisted, refusing to surrender. Small rebel factions joined forces, tyrannical empires combined their might, and numerous people went to wander the Worlds and the space in between then, alone but still fighting, refusing to give up hope and determined to learn more about what those strange creatures had done to their homes. Even though threats-- some new, some old, some beyond all imagination-- lurk just around the corner, the people refuse to give up, continuously pushing forward. And so their story begins...Based on Kingdom Hearts, sans the Disney, Fantasy Legends offers a take on the Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts series with a new twist added in.</desc>

    <desc>Join the world of Pokemon, up close and personal, but as you've never seen it before. Set in Kanto, the setting for many of the Pokemon titles, we rejoin the world twenty years after the events of Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen. Humans and pokemon work alongside one another, with the nefarious Team Rocket working behind the scenes on all manner of organized (and disorganized) crime, seeking money and influence.</desc>
    <desc>Of course, in the intervening two decades, Rocket has been far from idle...and a malfunction in their Snag Ball technology has caused a new sort of being, the pokemorph, to come into existence!</desc>
    <desc>Take up the banner of the noble Kanto police force, join the ranks of Team Rocket for glory and money, or adopt the mantle of Sassy Neutral and mock the foolishness of both.</desc>

    <desc>\"The world is older than any of you know, and contrary to popular mythology, it did not begin as a paradise. For untold eons, demons walked the earth; made it their home... their Hell. In time they lost their purchase on this reality, and the way was made for the mortal animals. For Man. What remains of the Old Ones are vestiges: certain magicks, certain creatures.\"</desc>
    <desc>Let The End Times Roll is a modern Buffy/Angelverse game set in sparkling Sin City -- the desert jewel -- Las Vegas. Beneath the flashing bright lights and glitzy glamour there's a darker side to the city. An underbelly that needs to be fed, and it's often the souls of the poor fools drawn to the lies and false promises on which she feeds. What will you be in this multi-layered world where dreams are made or broken on the throw of the dice or the flip of a card? Whatever your choice, you can be certain that nothing in Las Vegas is ever as it seems.</desc>
    <desc>We are utilizing the Unisystem Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel RPG rules. We have a fully coded Character Generation and dice- resolution system. You don't need any of the published rulebooks to play; our news files are very extensive and the code handles almost all of the work!</desc>

    <desc>Set in an original world with a fantasy horror theme and powered by a custom game engine, Maiden Desmodus offers an intense multiplayer role-playing environment.</desc>
    <desc>When the Kneyan Kingdom was conquered a hundred years ago and the Kneyan people of the mainland exterminated, The Isle became an independent kingdom. With the trade routes decimated by war, the Kneyans of The Isle settled into a peaceful and self-reliant existence. That is, until the arrival of a dark being that came to be known by the islanders as the Maiden Desmodus.</desc>
    <desc>The Maiden Desmodus, described as a witch by some, a vampire or demon by others, began feeding off of the population. Great efforts were made to slay the Maiden, yet all were futile. In time, the Kneyans forged an unspoken truce with â€œThe Crimson Goddessâ€ and blood was soon being offered in worship at temples throughout The Isle.</desc>
    <desc>However, a rebellion against the practices of traditional Desmoduism led to the fracturing of the Kneyan Kingdom, and now the emerging Kingdom of Thiria wages a brutal war with their former brothers to the south.</desc>
    <desc>Features include description driven character interaction, non automated combat, a player driven economy with extensive crafting, mass warfare and conquest, player run factions and political intrigue, hundreds of unique skills to learn, all original areas to explore, advanced custom web clientâ€¦ and much much more.</desc>

    <desc>Darkness Beneath the Fog: Welcome to modern day London, England. But this new London is not the one that we know and love. Rather, this is a London filled with Vampires, Shapeshifters, Magic, and a labour government. In this London, a place beneath the world mortals see exists. A darker place. A world of Darkness. The streets of London are no longer a safe place for children to play, for adults to stroll leisurely, for law enforcement to patrol. So frightening has the city become that law enforcement can't always be counted on to maintain the safety of London's inhabitants. Take head...you are on your own.</desc>
    <desc>Darkness Beneath the Fog is a newly opened World of Darkness MUSH based off the White Wolf World of Darkness, using a combination of 2nd and 3rd edition rules to encourage RP as well as alternative thinking. The game currently supports Shifters, Changeling, Kindred, and Mage, with some Demons thrown in for good measure. The Shifter sphere is accepting Garou, Bete, Corax, Ratkin, and many other Tribes. The Kindred sphere is open for Anarchs, Independents, Camarilla and Sabbat. Mage has openings for almost all the various mages including Verbena, VA, CoE, and Hermes (but not limited to those). Technocrats will be accepted in the near future. The Changeling sphere will be open for Seelie, Unseelie and Motley, and group apps are encouraged. Demons are being accepted on a case by case basis, and the wraith sphere will be opening once the game is in full swing. London has a strong staff committed to making the RP experience an enjoyable one for all players involved. There are a great many opportunities to get involved in one of the many sphere and mush- wide TPs constantly being planned, and staff welcomes players who wish to be a TP hook for a new TP.

    <desc>The Dragonball is an exciting, very unique Dragon Ball Z mud, that has been in development for about 7 years.  This mud strives to be different from the rest, to really submerge the player in the Dragon ball Z universe, and give them an experience they deserve.</desc>
    <desc>The Dragonball contains many unique features, which set it apart from the rest of the DBZ muds. One of which is a room coordinate system which allows for actual objects and mobs to be placed for the player to move around in the room to interact with. Another is the skill system which is well thought out and uniquely developed, with each skill having its own level, and features an unique skill evolution system to learn new skills by leveling the older ones, as well as many skills around the Dragonball world to be learned. On top of that we have devised a unique system that separates powerlevel from xp, which inturn is mixed with a very balanced, intelligent battle system.  The Dragonball is of a moderate size, over 7,500 rooms, with more added each day. But it is the quality not the quantity of these areas, which makes the mud stand out  There are 9 races available right now.  Those are -- Human -- Saiyan -- Halfbreed -- Icer -- Demon -- Namek -- Mutant -- Android -- Bio-Android</desc>
    <desc>Once again though, we are not your normal run of the mill DBZ mud. You canâ€™t become the strongest  or reach the maximum level in a couple of days. Infact there is no limit in The Dragonball. We know that isnâ€™t for everybody, and if you do have a problem with that, please donâ€™t bother to join up because thatâ€™s not what we are about and Iâ€™m sure you can find another saga clone to go play.</desc>
    <desc>If you are looking for something where you have to make an effort to be someone and not just have things handed to you, come in and enjoy a unique Dragon Ball Z experience within The Dragonball. Where a newbie friendly environment and many friends and enemies await to be made and conquered as you work your way to the universes most strongest</desc>

Equipment and areas are based entirely on the unique flavor of these major (or perhaps just plainly popular) cultures. Our world begins in the west, roughly that of Mid-Western Europe, as we continue to form a world filled with sights and sounds, occasional caravans bringing rare items will visit major cities bringing rumors, and tales of adventures as a taste of what is to come. When a unique region is opened to the players, so will the chance to create a new character based on a class exclusive to that territory be given. As knowledge of the unknown world is revealed the known world continues to change and evolve. Epic struggles of power, fame, and greed rage on in a land filled with myth, legend, and intrigue.</desc>

The memories of the utopian Second Age were still fresh, but none would relinquish sovereignty.

    <desc>Centuries ago, mages and men worked together throughout the realms. The Seven, those most powerful mages of the realms, guided both man and mage alike as needed.</desc>
    <desc>But in Sun Calendar 109, King Dav ab Harmon of Lithmore disregarded the advice of the Seven.  To warn him, or scare him perhaps, into acceding to their wishes, the Royal Apartments were immolated in fire. Either accidentally or intentionally, the Royal Family was slain that day, for all but King Dav himself were there.  Grief-stricken, Dav ran to the mountains, leaving all behind.  He was gone for over two months, and his seneschal oversaw the Royal Funerals and daily matters of the land. Finally, Authryn ab Sidharr, the seneschal, convened a Royal Council to determine the succession.</desc>
    <desc>King Dav returned during the time the Council was meeting, bedraggled and somewhat emaciated but very much alive.  Insane with grief and rage, the returned King pronounced to his Council that no longer would users of magic be suffered unto his land. He ordered a bounty for all known mages, and called for their deaths.</desc>
    <desc>And so it was that King Dav began the Consolidation, by taking through force of arms all Kingdoms which bordered his, and putting to death any he caught who used magic.  Gradually kingdom after kingdom fell to the onslaught of Dav's armies till in the end only the kingdom of Vavard remained to oppose the might of Lithmore.</desc>
    <desc>The Burning Post is set in the early period the inquisition.  The small island of New Yarsith located at the mouth of the Bren river serves as a focal point for events in the new kingdom in the years following King Dav's War of Consolidation.  Dubbed the city of borders, representatives from every major guild, duchy, and even the kingdom of Vavard have gathered there at the behest of the King.  At New Yarsith they will each vie to shape the future of the consolidated realm to their advantage in a bitter game of politics and intrigue. Lords and commoners both work to better their lot amidst the backdrop of intense religious inquisition.</desc>
    <desc>Written within the chronicles of Urth, what part of the story will you play?  Will you make your mark on the history of Urth or simply be a pawn?  Perhaps you will be rise through the ranks from a lowly steward of your cause to become a someone embroiled in the politics that drive it.  Or strike out on your own as a free agent, offering your services and sword to the highest bidder.  Perhaps even stake your own claim to Urth as an autocrat, beholden to no ones goals but yours.</desc>
    <desc>Be the noble knight who relentlessly hunts the vile users of magic, or the scheming thief on the lookout for pockets to pilfer, the mage who hides away and patiently bides the time till he masters the arcane arts or the inquisitor who brings the question to all and cleanses with fire.  Are you the bard who plays with an amiable smile, whilst listening intently for secrets to glean or the mercenary just looking for another job and bread to fill your stomach.  The possibilities are endless.</desc>
    <desc>We're currently in open beta and welcome everyone to play in this intensive roleplay environment.</desc>

    <desc>Land of the Unforgiven is a heavily modified Dystopia Gold. The areas have been COMPLETELY wiped and all exp areas and Midgaard are from scratch. At the moment the world is fairly small, but plenty of room for a lot of exping and PK. There are new areas being added EVERY DAY. There are 18 classes at the moment, with more to come, possibly including Skyblades from MCloud and Wraiths from EoD. The statcap is 20k with 4k added per kill, but the classes and equipment are modified to reflect this. The average test player has taken two to three hours to max a character, but mastery is possible in half an hour or less with the stancetrain, spelltrain, and weapontrain commands.</desc>

[star names and locations based upon astromomisal data, still working on it] some of them having their own lifeforms [just like in \"deathworld\" :)] others being only mining colonies or factories. so that way the Earth Federation was formed. it's member were all earth countries and their colonies. but some bigger colonies [with heavier industry and science] started rebellion, against that \"Earth Empire\" and in several interstellar wars formed \"League of Free Worlds\". and then the play begins...</desc>
    <desc>technicals: - modules to upgrade your ships - more realistic space ships** - possibility to land ANYWHERE on the planet** - building of houses on planet surfaces** - destroying and bombing them** - players making and running colonies** - hiding behind the barrels, crates.** - armor has no AC. instead when hit IN CERTAIN BODY PART armor on THAT PART reduces the damage** - characters could have families, and leave their cash and position to their offsprings** - medicine: doctors, breaking bones, diseases, etc. **</desc>
    <desc>*)looking for area builders. mail me if you want to help building earth. it should be dark and cyberpunk-like. full of drugs and violence. but ranged weapons [blasters/grenades] should be HIGHLY illegal and anyone having it will be shot dead by the police. but there also will be 'higher class' of citizents.living in \"Garden of Eden\"s closed for normal people. **) to be added.</desc>

    <desc>BSAE is a circlemud 3.1 based mud with oasis OLC and dgscripts. It's been in operation about 3 years, in closed alpha development. The theme is star wars, and the idea is to create a world that is as authentic and roleplayable as possible, as well as stunning to the imagination. BSAE runs on a dedicated dell poweredge 400sc, off a cable line. Most of the programming work thats been put in, has been to a project we call the builder bot. This is a bot that pulls randomly from seed files, and creates enormous worlds for players to explore. The idea behind this being to leave the filler rooms to the bot, and let the builders do the fun stuff. BSAE is a mud that will be a far cry from traditional mudding experiences. we have vision, we have talent, we have a wide variety of resources, and we are quite determined; Come check us out.</desc>

He was kind, and the light he brought was very appreciated by the masses of people that had been living in darkness for so long. F'nor, and his dragon Canth, were Gods in the eyes of those around. But there was one who remembered the darkness. One who found the light to be oppressing, and not as benevolent as those around. Her heart was as pitch, black and thick with hatred. This one was Alys. Alys had seenhow F'nor did his tricks and powers, and soon taught herself to emulate those powers, although she could not match F'nor's power in those skills. She planned to overthrow F'nor and return the world to the state of darkness it was before, the way she remembered and loved....</desc>

    <desc>We are a very new MUD, currently looking for builders/coders and individuals who can collaborate with the admin team on new and cool ideas for the game. It is based on the Star Wars: Rise In Power game, which I played a while back when it was running. The general idea I have in mind is to create new planets, new ships, add lots more code.. here's an outline of what I have in mind:</desc>
    <desc>- create special areas with very tough NPCs and puzzles that you have to solve, like in legend of zelda. You'd have to group to enter these areas as well, we might have to code a grouping/loot distribution system.</desc>
    <desc>- create new technology, such as transporters that allow cargo and people to be transported between orbitting ships and planets.</desc>
    <desc>- we could create defined roles so that players would have more of an idea what to do in the game. There are already classes like pilot, smuggler, combat... but we could elaborate upon them: mercenary, bodyguard, intelligence officer, cargo transporter, diplomatic envoy, etc.</desc>
    <desc>- We will work together to make the best possible gaming experience for our players!</desc>
    <desc>- By the way, I have checked items in this MUD entry that are not necessarily in the game at this time. However, I do plan to add them eventually.</desc>
    <desc>If you are a player, feel free to join our game at any time. Since we're using a well developed codebase, there's lots to do. Enjoy!</desc>

The population of Earth had grown beyond the limited space of the planet. The solution was clear.  It had been discussed for years.  A planet much like a very primitive Earth had been discovered many light years away.  Thankfully, space travel had now advanced to the point that the distance could be covered in a relatively short time. The problem now was that no one wanted to leave Earth.  So, who would go?  The solution came relatively quickly.  Orphans, criminals and other outcasts from society would be sent to the new planet to live.  From a statistics perspective, it was a good decision.  The ones who would be left on Earth could keep all of their resources, because they did not feel the resources should be</desc>

    <desc>Yet another version of the wonder Roleplay-based MUD that is Age of Destiny.  Paul Clarke (Gideon x) Did a wonderful job coding it and in the past it has been hosted by many different groups.  The head admin of this version has been playing the mud frequently for years now and enjoys it so much that he's decided to host his own version. The MUD's character classes include Humans, Vampires, and Werewolves based on the rules of the White-Wolf Roleplaying Games.</desc>

    <desc>Los Angeles. Land of sun, palm trees, and smog. Its glittering surface promises opportunity, productivity, and perhaps even glamour and fame. A place where the rich, the poor, the old, the young, and all those in between live out their lives in the great rat race.</desc>
    <desc>Claw your way past the glitter though, and Los Angeles is another city entirely. For it harbors a darker side a side. A side filled with the promise of violence, of blood, of things spoken of only in tales of horror.</desc>
    <desc>There are those who make it their mission to protect the unfortunates, but just as there are guardians, there are also adversaries. It's a constant struggle to stay one step ahead of the opposition, and the stakes are high. So high that the entirety of humanity will be affected if good men fail.</desc>
    <desc>Welcome to the City of Angels.</desc>
    <desc>Angel City MUSH is set in 2001 Los Angeles, just after the finales of Angel Season 2 and Buffy Season 5. Angel and the gang returned from the dimension of Pylea as heroes, having rescued Cordelia and Fred. But their victory is diminished by the sorrowful news brought to them by Willow: Buffy has died, having sacrificed herself to prevent the destruction of the world.</desc>
    <desc>And with the world saved, it would seem that everything would go back to normal, right? Think again. Demons, vampires, along with other monsters and beings of power continue to roam the city. The monolith law firm of Wolfram and Hart continues its nefarious pursuits. The apocalypse has only been delayed.</desc>
    <desc>Will you help prevent it, or bring it about?</desc>

    <desc>RavenMUD was originally started by a handful of people from Da Shadow's Domain and ShadowMUD.  After many modifications from its original code Raven now has many unique features including: improved A.I. Mobs (NPCs) using special procedures and more recently DG Scripts, multi functional magic items, numerous operational cities, and an online creation system, just to list a few.  Player grouping and role playing are quite popular with 11 classes and 11 standard plus 9 remort races to choose from.  Exploring Raven's vast and ever expanding areas will not be a hassle, with saved aliases and abbreviated commands to ease the amount of typing. Clans and custom clan housing that offers to many options to list add greatly to an already rich role playing environment. Planned and impromptu quests are frequently run with various themes and objectives that range from capture the flag, city defense, seek and destroy, rescue missions, treasure hunts, capture the flag, and many many more. A talented Imm and mortal staff continuously produce original areas and improve game play in many facets. An entire city is devoted to players new to MUDs is available to start in with helpful and informative mobs and help files to get your journey underway. Raven is very stable and has been around for quite sometime and will continue to exist indefinitely. Whether new to the game or a veteran this is everything you are looking for in a MUD.</desc>

Now, the forces of competing nation-states are scrabbling to expand into the galaxy, fortifying and industrialising former frontier worlds, and searching for potential alien allies.

    <desc>With the murder of the royal family, a grieving monarch set out to eradicate a great evil running rampant through the kingdom of Lithmore: magic. His fury and determination soon destroyed political alliances and forged a new empire from the ashes of his enemies. The genocide of all those who practice the magical arts, however, could not be completed in his day alone...</desc>
    <desc>Centuries later, the struggle for survival still rages between all users of magic and ever-viligant might of the Holy Order. Immerse yourself in the suspicion and mystery of a realm embroiled in a clandestine holy war, where honor and politics all too frequently collide - and magic is real.  Will you join in the fight to erase the evil taint of sorcery from the realm - or unlock the secrets of the forbidden arts, and rise against oppression? </desc>

Aunque el entorno está influenciado por Reinos Olvidados, DragonLance, El Señor de los Anillos y Stormbringer y se pueden encontrar razas que aparecen en estas sagas y regiones del mundo que pueden recordar a ellas, la ambientación es c ompletamente original, y no se ajusta a una en concreto, con lo cual seguramente encontrarás diferencias entre como esperas que sea una raza, cultura o monstruo y como lo es realmente en Eirea.

    <desc>Chaos is back, with a new administration. Come join us, as we improve the Chaos code, and bring back a place that people were upset about when it shut down. Lately we've been one of the fasting climbing MUDs on this site, and we are constantly updating and refining gameplay.</desc>
    <desc>From the whirling blades of Barbarians to the heroic cleave of mental warriors like the Reaver, the magical mastery of Warlocks, Bards and Wizards to the trickery of a Ninja's smokebomb, you will have no problem finding a class to suit your fancy.</desc>
    <desc>The races also add an extra dimension to gameplay. Shadows can slip through doors and into rooms unnoticed, and the reclusive halflings never fail to hide from the eyes of others. The blood of vampires runs hot in the middle of the night as they leech health from their victims, and demons cause a great blight to theirs. Angels rejoice with heavenâ€™s charge and grow in their heavenly union to create a bond of strength with their deity.  Chaos is a heavily modified Merc code that was created for a fully customizable Fantasy world. We offer lots of original areas with mob interaction and mob-run quests, as well as a few customized, generic areas and an intricate system of roads, rivers, and oceans. We have 16 races, offer clans with clan rooms and associated bonuses, and a myriad other custom features.  Chaos has 500 player levels where you play the first 100 levels in one of 6 main classes. Then at level 100 players must choose between three different specializations of their class, with each specialization having a unique skill set with their own weaknesses and strengths. There is a damage, utility, and tank specialization for each of the six main classes. After Level 500, there are the LEGEND levels, with their own unique skills, quests, and equipment.</desc>
    <desc>If you would like to wield a legendary Chaos weapon and acquire special orbs through quests to increase your weapon's power, slay potent enemies with spells and skills like Were-dragon, Force Spikes, Ultimo, Assassinate, Midnight Blast, Dragon Strike, Swirling Blades, and Whirlwind or travel through the world with an Energy Vortex or a Ghostly Steed, then Chaos is the place for you.

    <desc>Vampire Wars: The New Era is a new generation of VW (Vampire wars theme). The New Era offers a load of fantastical new areas, but we did keep stock in as well, so people will feel fairly comfortable at first and then progress to the newer areas that we have placed in the mud. We have made major changes in the code to allow mastery from lvl 1-10 in disciplines available. Diab will be introduced and allow people to diab each other for generation. Players will start at gen 12 and be able to reach gen 3. Justicars will be chosen and fought amongst by the players within each clan. There will be no admin favoritism, every person will have a fair chance and trial for any issues between people. Admins will rarely get involved unless an issue is VERY serious, other than that, player issues stay player issues. We encourage role-playing but don't enforce it, though it does add some flavor to the game. We are striving to make this one of the best and most active Vampire Wars of them all.</desc>
    <desc>We are also introducing all 13 clans, including Caitiff for the first time in any VW mud. There will be clan specific disciplines on a master from 1-10 and general disciplines that players can choose from.</desc>
    <desc>We make a promise that there will be some form of update at least once a month, if we do not meet this expectation, we will give out around 500 quest points to each player (Which is a fair amount of quest points for doing nothing). We will definitely be running quests and gearing the game towards players. If the majority of players want something a specific way, we will cater the mud towards that design. It is our mud to run, though we believe it is the players mud and they should shape the world in which they play with their opinions.</desc>

    <desc>We just started the mud, it's up and operational but we're no where near done with it =). We need competent builders so if you think your up to it, think about it some more and then get back to us. As for regular players, just come on in and have some fun, get your character built up before anyone else has the chance. We'll probably throw in bonuses for early players.</desc>
    <desc>The reason its called Sarith's Revenge is 'cause Sarith is my character on most muds and we would get fed up with the crap and stupidity there, so we decided to make our own and leave all the crap behind. Hopefully this mud will be really fun for you guys. Sign up, screw around, do whatever. Just have fun.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Windy City MUX, a non-World of Darkness game set in Chicago and based off the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton.  It's a world where vampires have rights, zombies don't, shapeshifters are discriminated against despite it being illegal to do so, and humans can raise the dead for a living. In short, it's a modern world that will look mostly the same to you and me, but the monsters that we all thought were storybook creatures are out mingling with the rest of us.</desc>
    <desc>Accepted concepts include all flavors of vampire, were-things, many sorts of fae, psychically talented humans, magically able humans, animators of the dead, and many others!</desc>

Various means are used to ensure mobiles are diverse and unique. Enviromental changes are made possible through room progs and custom code.  A personal spirit helps the novice mudder learn their way around, so being a newbie on PoopMud is not so daunting for the novice. Immortals and Elders are available to answer questions and give suggestions in order to help the novice mudder develop into a fully experienced player. A togglable hints channel gives the new player suggestions of useful information.  At level 50, players may choose either a secondary class or the same class, to create either an expert or a more diverse character. Once reaching level 50 with the secondary class, statistics may be improved via the meta shop.  A functioning arena is available for controlled PK games.  There are over 100 automatic quests, plus imm-led quests. Quest Points earned can be used to buy Orbs and powerful scrolls and potions.  The Well contains 20 levels of over 6000 randomly generated rooms and mobs. The mobs in The Well have fragments, which can be used to gain a super race called K'ta'viir (KTV).

    <desc>	Are you an old-school mudder?  One for whom Midgaard feel like a second home?  Quickâ€¦whatâ€™s the path from temple square to the Assassinâ€™s Guild?  Your fingers never forget these things.  Fondly rembember the thrill of killing trees?  Do you ever sometimes feel that newer muds have become so hugely feature-rich and complex that all the math and tactics take all the fun out of the pure hack-n-slash?  That, in retrospect, four classes and a handful of skills and spells were plenty to have a good time? 	Or are you brand-new to mudding?  Want to cut your teeth on something simple and straightforward, not having to read a textbook just to get into the game and see if itâ€™s for you? 	Or do you play a modern Mud, but have always been curious about that text about something called â€œGammaâ€ at the login prompt and those strange, Scandinavian-sounding names?  Wonder what life was like back at the damn of mudding time? 	If any of these ideas intrigue you, then you shoud definitely try FuskerMUD! 	FuskerMUD is one of the oldest Dikus still in existence.  And itâ€™s about as close as youâ€™ll come these days to the original gamma experience.  That doesnâ€™t mean here arenâ€™t any enhancements, of course.  In fact, the code is highly reworked.  But always, the philosophy has been to keep as close as possible to the classic gameplay. Warrior, Thief, Cleric, Wizard.  Thatâ€™s all you get to start withâ€¦though once you max out these, thereâ€™s an Avatar class to keep progressing in.  Yes, some areas are stock, but sometimes those old areas are, get this, actually FUN TO PLAY IN!  And donâ€™t worry, thereâ€™s plenty of original areas too.</desc>

    <desc>It's six years after the events of Star Trek: Nemesis that threw the Romulan Empire into chaos. Commander Donatra has been named the Praetor, and after several years of consolidating the Romulan government it has finally stabilized. The Klingon Empire has fully recovered from its losses during the Dominion War under the leadership of Chancellor Martok. Martok continues to keep peaceful relations with the Federation, while others within the empire are becoming thirsty for battle again. The Cardassian Union is still rising from its ashes after its defeat in the Dominion War. Six years ago the interim government handed power over to the members of the new Detapa Council, marking the begin of the full withdrawal of allied forces from Cardassian space.</desc>
    <desc>The United Federation of planets has relished in the relative peace that it has had for the past six years. Warships from the Dominion War are being refitted back into their original exploration configurations. New designs are being built at shipyards, made for discovery in a new era.</desc>
    <desc>But will this era of peace last? Will the powers of the Alpha Quadrant fall back into old grudges? And what will Starfleet find in the reaches of deep space?</desc>
    <desc>100 years after the launch of the USS Excelsior, the first of a long line of ships that would form the backbone of the fleet, a new class has been launched to replace it. The USS Vanguard is the second Excalibur-class ship launched, an entirely new design based upon the Excelsior and the classic Constitution lines, built with technology pioneered and improved upon in the Sovereign and other classes. The Vanguard is being launched on its 5-year mission, to explore strange, new worlds.</desc>
    <desc>Star Trek: The Final Frontier is a 'one-ship' Star Trek MUSH, meaning everyone is a member of the same crew, aiming to capture the spirit of TOS and TNG with the crew exploring the galaxy and going on away missions. A story outline has been made already for it, and players are also encouraged to run their own plots, and are given the tools to do so. While an outline may already be in place, the story will adapt to player actions as the players help shape the narrative. We are RP-driven instead of code-driven, with code never replacing RP.</desc>

    <desc>The world is fantasy oriented, with circle 2.20 original areas and lots of custom zones,races,classes,spells... The mud is currently not very newbie friendly, but rather oriented toward high level characters grinding.</desc>

If you're looking for a competitive, yet non-exhaustive environment, then you have found the right place. *Abandoned Legacy offers a Newbie-Friendly environment and an extensive pk system. Newbie protection is enforced by the code, to ensure that you are not killed when you first log in, but the choice remains for you to give up newbie protection. *The Mud is quite stable, with an auto-recover script that keeps the mud up and running 99.9% of the time. *All stock Low4 classes have been debugged, revamped and balanced to improve the PK aspect of the mud. *The custom class Dragon has been added and more classes will be added along the way. The mastery system brings new dimensions to the standard classes, along with various skills that have been added in. *Current Classes: Demon, Dragon, Drow, Mage, Monk, Ninja, Paladin, Vampire, Werewolf. *Two new questing systems are in - find the object, or the mob. And for those lucky players, gambling (both blackjack and craps) has been implemented. All three ways are great alternatives to standard questing. *Highly competitive kingdoms are offered, each with their own kingdom hall. *Original ideas are constantly implemented. -Raoul</desc>

    <desc>The Jedi Order is beginning to reform itself and slowly track down and train new Jedi. The Dark Jedi, in less conspicuous ways, are also beginning to reform.</desc>
    <desc>Just one year ago, the New Republic stopped using Guerilla Warfare and began using open tactics of war to get what they wanted. They began capturing worlds in the Core Worlds with the idea of using Coruscant as their capitol.</desc>
    <desc>The Empire struggles to regain what was once theirs and skirmishes still break out between the newly established Republic and the badly broken Empire.</desc>
    <desc>Come forth and join us. Play in a world where Star Wars is brought to life. The Staff here at Sw:Gi are always struggling to make the mud as real as possible.

    <desc>At Galactic Insights, we're devoted to promoting the SWR community as much as possible. We've recently developed the Loan system, allowing a player to take a loan for credits and pay it off in due time. Of course, there are repurcussions when you don't. :) This loan system is the first of it's kind on a developed SWR based MUD, and Sw:Gi did it first, and we did it best.</desc>

    <desc>Shades of Grey is a World of Darkness mush set in Ketchikan, Alaska. We are a small mush of a few years old, looking for mostly lower level characters of all spheres, especially vampire, mage, demon and changeling. Other races might be welcome but would need discussion with staff.</desc>
    <desc>We are a different game in that we have a preferences based system and the roleplay is cooperative, instead of the much more widely used competitive system. However, despite using a cooperative system, staff will keep an active hand in keeping the flavor and the dangers of living in the World of Darkness a threatening and challenging place and make sure players do not abuse the rp preferences (people cannot do anything they want without ic consequences, we just try to fit the consequences to what is interesting to roleplay). We are trying to stress the roleplay side of things more than the dice-rolling side, to be a place open to intersphere roleplay and different inter- pretations of the WoD system, and a heavy stress on non- linear storylines.</desc>
    <desc>If you want to know more, feel free to come take a look at our website at http://www.shades-of-grey.info or the game at shades-of-grey.info port 2828 and feel free to ask any staff online any questions you might have!</desc>

After the showdown between Albus Dumbledor and 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named' at the end of their Fifth year, things became rather quiet as the Dark Lord apparently took himself off to places unknown. This was fortunate as there was a great deal of cleanup to be done at the headquarters of the Ministry in London.</desc>
    <desc>Sixth year passed calmly enough with only the usual school interactions. Seventh year began and seemed to be content to follow in the footsteps of the one preceding when rumours of a is concerting nature began to surface.</desc>
    <desc>Tales of an increase in the dark population were heard, originating in Eastern Europe. Vampires and weres of all sorts were spotted and attacks began to be more and more commonplace. But this was far away and there was no reason to believe that it might be heading towards the more populated and civilized regions of the world.</desc>
    <desc>It is currently summer and there are several weeks before the term begins with a new class of first years.

    <desc>-* The zones are completely original and new ones are discovered every day. Kormar mud can boast a full 200 plus zones!</desc>
    <desc>-* Kormar Mud is a FULL PvP mud. The underlying story, and playability revolves around PvP. This mud caters to PvPcentric players, but, has stunning zones for the zoner. A unique part of Kormar is the zone changes. IE: You could be in a human town during the day that just doesn't seem right, once night time comes, you begin to notice shrieks in the distance, and this is when the vampires/beasts of the night have come to feast.</desc>
    <desc>-* Kormar Mud is for people who are looking for a challenge in a generally stagnant hack and slash Mudding experience. Don't be afraid to log in and ask the IMMs any questions.</desc>
    <desc>Cheers and Happy Mudding!</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Kingdom Wars, one of the few great medieval/fantasy MUDs around.  We have over 70 areas, and many many features that have been added in to make the MUD more exciting for players. To list some of the things: A Ship System, a better designed automated quest system, player run clans, In-Game quests, and much more.  There is something here for every medieval/fantasy fanatic.  Many new skills for all of the classes, as well as every race having an automatic racial ability.  Leveling has been made more difficult, meaning you wont reach level 130 in 1 day. Some of the things Im planning on putting in are customizable weapons, and new skills/spells. So if you want to experience a new type of medieval/fantasy experience, drop on by and check us out.</desc>

    <desc>Dressed in the most fashionable silks or tattered dirty clothing, traveling across Ellandor is always a rewarding experience. A world filled with many extravagant quests for money, treasures and fame. Protecting the innocents of the main city Devenon. A life of twisted words and loot would be great if one were accepted into the Crimson Fang Pirate Gang. Joining the Imperial Army to rid the world of magic users and Sylari races. Training in the deep twisted mines of volcanoes, heavily wooded forests, and rocky mountain trails.</desc>
    <desc>Abandoned Reality is a great mud for first timers, with easy directions and commands. The world map is great for the ones that love to explore the land, also easy to navigate through. Plenty of player and organization owned boats to travel across the bodies of water. Easy character creation with a well made newbie area for those inexperienced players.</desc>
    <desc>Abandoned Reality was the first mud that I had ever tried and probably the only one I will ever play and work on. I found it easy to pick up the commands, spells, directions. There aren't any northwest/northeast/southeast/southwest directions, which helped out a lot. The world map and boats have to be my favorite part about Abandoned Reality myself. Many of the experienced players are friendly and offer plenty of help for those that need any questions answered.</desc>

    <desc>\"After the Earth was used up, we found a new solar system and hundreds of new Earths were terraformed and colonized. The Central Planets formed the Alliance and decided all the planets had to join under their rule.</desc>
    <desc>There was some disagreement on that point.</desc>
    <desc>After the war, many of the Independents who had fought and lost, drifted to the edges of the system far from Alliance control. Out here, people struggle to get by with the most basic technologies. A ship would bring you work. A gun would help you keep it. A captain's goal was simple: Find a crew, find a job.

    <desc>Welcome to FireflyMUX! When \"Firefly\" first aired in 2002, Joss Whedon painted a gritty, realistic sci-fi world based in the 26th century - a rich, colourful and diverse civilization five hundred years in the future where cultures collide and blend seamlessly. With the intriguing genre of \"space western\" tied to its name, it brings up combined images of spaceships and horses, high technology and the old frontier, corrupt government and gunfights. Then, when \"Serenity\" hit the big screen this fall, we were given more insight, more adventure, and more danger. But overall, it's all about people ... their freedom and survival, their very human triumphs and losses. Today, this world provides us with a unique opportunity for roleplay. It provides us with FireflyMUX.</desc>

There are no stars or moon in the night sky and the sun does not shine in the day. Determining what the actual time is near impossible and the handful of most survivors arent old enough to remember the old world. Finding food is almost always a struggle. Most weapons are makeshift pointy sticks and working weapons are worth their weight in gold, assuming anyone had any gold. The industrialized industries no long exist everything must be made from hand unless someone has a \"secret\" way for acquiring the objects. And then there are the creatures . . .</desc>

    <desc>With terraforming becoming a popular event, much of the galaxy is occupied in the year 2395.  The humans have divided themselves into three alliances, mostly based on strict political ideals.  Even after a long-lasting bloody war against the aggresive alien species designated WEH-83D, renamed Praelor, the people are still divided. Space travel through wormholes is as common as air travel was in the 20th century, and it's rare for a person not to own a ship and bounce from planet to planet at their leisure, for there is much to do in Miriani.  From shopping for clothes to hauling asteroids for cash to space combat missions for experience, few find themselves with nothing to do.  Gaining the experience of small combat is essential for young pilots, because there is always talk of the Praelor returning to claim Miriani space as their own.  Vicious creatures that will let nothing stand in their way, the Praelor have little regard for lives that are not their own.  Will you be a pilot brave enough to get scratched up, sacrifice a ship and some sanity?</desc>
    <desc>Miriani is now in open-beta. Anyone can join and create a character. Once complete, Miriani will be a MOO with a rich backstory, beautiful and original planets to explore, and many fun ways to earn credits or points. So come check us out! Make some friends, make some enemies and just generally have a good time. We have very active and friendly staff who are willing to answer all of your questions and help you get started.</desc>

    <desc>You are in a laboratory in the midst of Nevada, where unknown experiments take place. Rumours from the nearest cities tell of vulgar experiments involving sexual depravity, such as civilised people have never dreamed of.</desc>
    <desc>The lab itself is self funding, a free flow of information is provided to its sister research centres, and is founded on land now deemed as international. Here, the laws are made by the senior administration of the laboratory, and summary execution is also permitted.  The main premise of the lab is to advance the human understanding of life, and has military backup when required, courtesy of Area 51, to which the labs staff are the only civilian organisation allowed access. As such, humans, and often aliens, are quite common in equal measure, though some 'aliens' are merely genetically modified human life-forms.</desc>
    <desc>One common element of this lab, is that, although the place is guarded, anyone is free to step up to the building and enter, though from eye-witness reports, nothing, and no-one EVER comes out, not even in a box. This is because, in an effort to protect both the general populace, and to prevent information leaks, any escapee is promptly killed on sight, by one of the many automated weapons systems, hidden around the grounds.</desc>

    <desc>This would seem like your typical DikuMUD.  It started with classes, and 30 to 50 levels, and in fact, sometimes we put that version up. Essentially we have an archive of over 27 years of versions of this mud-all which are radically different from each other. The particular one we are running, and plan to be running for a long time, has 5000 levels(you become immortal when you reach level 5000)and consists of your typical dikumud areas, along with some interesting higher level areas, and several attempts at humor hidden within these areas, and equipment within, added throughout the years.  It truly is fun, and there usually is someone on willing to help newbies.  If you've ever played a traditional circlemud or dikumud, you'll be able to figure this out.  And remember -- this is the longest running DikuMUD EVER. There's a reason for that: it was always at either judy.indstate.edu 2150, henry.indstate.edu, or fred.indstate.edu, and now it is on blackshell.com 2150, so unfortunately we've lost a lost of players. However you're welcome to come!  There is always someone on wanting to give you the secrets of the game, and help you out!  Cheers!</desc>

    <desc>2005's Caer Dubrin is a mud that is still in beta phase. However the code offers very unique features to players. This includes a learning system based on spheres, which are set depending on what race, guild, and god you choose. That is another thing we use, a system based little on the 5 classes (all they do is determine what guilds you can join), but entirely on the combination of race/guild/god you choose. We also make use of DG Scripts, including automatic quests using the scripts. None of these are implemented as yet, because in addition to the code being in a beta state the world is still being built. We also offer an extended remort system with 50 total remorts. The first 30 remorts are considered normal remorts, while the last 20 are considered quest remorts. If you're interested in play testing, OR in becoming a builder, please email me using the link that is in this listing :)</desc>

    <desc>Wouldn't it be odd if we got a Mogwai, a catgirl, a clockwork dragon, a dimension-hopping crime fighter, a Jedi, a small plush gryphon, an American tourist, and a rock golem in the same room, and then let them talk over a few drinks? Many roleplay worlds gather together people of similar circumstances, and let them interact in this way. Such play is no doubt very enjoyable, but here at Nexus, we like doing the unusual. In a world where you might be completely unique, or at best merely one of a scant few, how would you react? Could you forge yourself a living?</desc>
    <desc>NexusMUSH is a world built around an unstable portal. Beings being droppped here quite unexpectedly from all across the universe have done their best to make a world for themselves. In a world where you can run into dragons, dinosaurs, robots and more, your imagination (and just a little common sense) is the limit.</desc>
    <desc>Utilities, mostly coded in-house, are present to assist and facilitate roleplay, which is the focus and purpose of NexusMUSH. Character creation is open, so none of that 'waiting several weeks for a reply' of some other MUSHes! We're not elitist, and our wizards are very newbie-friendly; all we seek is people who are willing and able to engage in wholesome, developing roleplay within our multilayered setting. Our world grows as our playerbase does, too.</desc>
    <desc>Nexus, by its very definition, has something that everyone can enjoy, and in a world crossed with drastically varied mixtures of technology and magic, our aim is for a place that is truly beyond imagination. If you're interested, connect as a guest and read the story of Nexus, or talk to other players and hear about their characters and their views. We hope to see you there!</desc>

    <desc>So, you want to know about Primal Fear? Well, lets start here... What is Primal Fear? Primal Fear is the prodigal child of numerous snippets of Godwars, Mindcloud, and Dystopia code. It's a PK MUD, and I'll go ahead and say it right now: It's NOT for pansies. If you're gonna log on and ask \"What's PK?\", just do me a favor and ingest some Drano now. This is kill or be killed, and the sooner that is realized, the sooner you'll be climbing to the top. Yes, you'll probably die a few times getting started, but contrary to popular belief, the players here will be more than happy to help you... (But only so they can kill you later).</desc>
    <desc>Now that we've got that out of the way, I can answer your next question. \"Why should I play Primal Fear?\" PF has been around for a long time. Changes and updates are a fluent part of the PF experience. In all honesty, there are far too many changes for me to list here. As of this moment, there are 811 logged changes; Some major, some minor.</desc>
    <desc>Here's the bottom line. If you're competitive, enjoy killing people, enjoy frequent changes, and appreciate staff members that listen to suggestions, you need to play this MUD... Plain and simple... If you whine or you're an effeminate hippie, you can play anyway, but you probably won't get very far. Why are you still reading this? Log on already.</desc>

    <desc>Lands of Lore is set up in a medieval atmosphere. We offer 14 classes, and 16 races for players to choose from upon creation. Two new classes are in the works. There are currently 800 levels a player can achieve, and a quest at level 800 to become of LEGEND status. Playerkilling(PK) was recently added and is optional for players (if turned on it can be turned off, it's not permanent). Also, rather than PKing, Lands of Lore has battle arenas where different level battles can be opened and players in the range can fight. Players can also join clans once achieving the correct level. Clan enhancements (such as shops, portals, mounts, rooms, healers, bank, furniture, etc.) can be bought for the clan hall. Quests for players occur at certain level increments(149, 199, 249, 299, 349) to gain differnt titles, as well as other quests for equipment and other items. Immortals are on often and will help when asked, as well as offer random spellups and sometimes a game of trivia. Lands of Lore offers a bit for everyone and is easy to learn and fun to play. The only thing we ask is for players to follow rules, and enjoy the game. Visit the website for updates on the game and log in and check us out!</desc>

FC's and OC's alike are welcome on the game and an easy application encourages new ideas.</desc>
    <desc>So far, there has been a Sentinel attack, exposing mutants to the world.  While there is some further acceptance than initially, humans still fear and loathe mutants on a whole.</desc>
    <desc>Raven Darkholme, aka Mystique, is no longer principle of Bayville High.  After losing the fight with Storm, and not being chosen to join Magneto on Asteroid M to go through his device which was supposed to bring mutants to their full potential, she snuck up herself, and got caught in the machine.  However, she maintained her presence at the school, in the form of Risty.  And though everyone thinks she was turned into stone to release Apocalypse, then broken into many pieces, she re-appears, her powers being amplified by Apocalypse, once he's released.</desc>
    <desc>Xavier's Institute for Gifted Youngsters, along with the Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants have been exposed as havens for mutantkind, and the X-Men not only helped to keep Magneto from realizing his plan of world domination, but they defeated Juggernaut, Xavier's half-brother, when he came in search of Xavier.</desc>
    <desc>Everything that happened in the series, from start to finish, is the past as the game starts just at the rolling of the final credits on Ascension pt 2.  The show is the past, time for the future.</desc>

The water was yet calm, but a cold breeze brought a blush on her cheeks. Gravely, she received his thoughts, but as he left she knew it was inevitable. And so the city rose. High above the world and high above the clouds, vanishing into universe's ether.</desc>
    <desc>Atlantis. A name that brings up many question and quickens imagination. Much has there been written and much has been said. Uncountable songs sung about the city that was buried by the ocean; but, several million years later, we know the truth. It was the city of the ancients that rose instead of drowned.</desc>
    <desc>Yet, this secret was concealed for so long. It had to take the courage of four humans to discover the truth. It nearly took their lives. But they survived and protected whole humankind against a powerful enemy. No doubt, the SG-1 team will never be forgotten.</desc>

    <desc>Key cities in the setting have been created, such as Tar Valon, Caemlyn, Aringill, Bandar Eban and Fal Dara - as well as the Two Rivers, starting place of the books.  A system of roads, carts, ferries and boats connects the entire world.  Though the road system hasn't been completely described, it is -complete- letting you explore every corner of the world.</desc>
    <desc>Reflections of the Wheel offers unique crafting opportunities for any level of player - from smithing to cooking, mixing various ingredients with tools to create new items from scratch, and even have a chance for \"High Quality\" items that are above the norm.  With a completely coded Auction House, items can be bought, sold, and traded even when the potential buyers and sellers aren't online.</desc>
    <desc>Roleplay is, as always, the mainstay at Reflections of the Wheel. Though the codebase is unique, robust, and incredible for the mobbing experience, certain advantages - and ability points to gain them - can only be gained through active participation in roleplay.</desc>
    <desc>Currently looking for active staff. The code, world and playerbase is constantly improving.</desc>

    <desc>FMA:EE is now open for Beta-Testing! Our official opening will be on Halloween 2006.  The game hosts a wide variety of rooms that give our player-base the option of exploring a vast environment without being over crowded.</desc>
    <desc>Our theme starts mid-season of the anime Full Metal Alchemist Series. (Around Episode 22-24). This means that Greed has escaped with the Chimeras from Lab 5, Ed and Al have learned the dark secret behind the creation of the Philospher's Stone, and other important events. We felt starting mid-season would allow our feature characters room to play and grow without having some of them already dead/dying like Hughes or Greed. We’ve left this theme semi-vague in hopes of allowing time for OC characters to develop themselves and establish their own IC adventures alongside the main Feature Characters. (As well as allow people to apply and fill roles of Feature Characters like Sloth, Ed, Winry, and others.)</desc>
    <desc>Feel free to stop by the game and ask us questions. Our game is based on a RP system and not Combat. Original characters (as well as FCs) may hunt for the Philosopher's Stone, pick up a 'craft', work in the Military, be an Alchemist or even play a Chimera. In addition, we've a set of OC-created (7)Homunculi that are slowly looking to be filled!</desc>
    <desc>Some features we’ve established on our game: -A wide variety of lands, occupations, ranks. -Have a wide variety of IC Positions/Ranks! -Play your own original State Alchemist, Chimera, or Miliary person among many others! -Earn special features/rewards through RP and our cookie program. -Play Homunculi or Chimeras like Martel, and Wrath. -Establish your own OC Groups within a given position (like Military) or form a gang that's in the city.</desc>

Then a very detailed character creation system, to make your char exactly how you want, character traits, and hometowns are available. This MUD will be half-and-half of PK and RP. I was brought up on a MUD of that mannor, so I find that mix is perfect. Then there will be 12 classes, and 7 races.

    <desc>Address : orfal.game-host.org:4000 MUD-type: ROM (2.4) Purpose : proof of concept</desc>
    <desc>The reason for this MUD's existance is two-fold: test the possibility to run a full-blown MUD on cheap ( &lt; 100$) hardware with minimal powerconsumption and nominal speed. Enhance the MUD and eventually release detailed instructions for any person to do this on his own (Linux-based) router.</desc>
    <desc>Hardware on which the MUD is running : Linksys WRT-54G router 32Mb RAM You read it right: this MUD runs on a Linksys router running Linux 2.4 (Sveasoft kernel), 32 Mb of RAM and a 200 Mhz MIPS-processor - no harddrive.</desc>
    <desc>The whole ROM MUD is therefore backed up regularly to remote storage. In case the router is rebooted, the MUD is restored within 15 minutes (backed up ever 30 minutes).</desc>
    <desc>The MUD itself is very basic, and I hope you will give it a try so I can see the real-world implications of running an embedded Linux MUD :)</desc>

Our emphasis is on player driven stories, proactive player actions which impact the theme and direction of the game, and encouraging player creativity. Barriers to entry are low and players new to text games or to MUSHes are welcome.</desc>
    <desc>An Empire has risen from the ashes of the collapsed Nerath era and is spreading her influence across the untamed lands. Her newest jewel is the city of Xylara, a recently completed colonial town far from the heart of the Empire which offers countless possibilities to homesteaders, settlers, and explorers of her lands. What is to become of these lands, who rules them, and what are their goals is up to those whom come to fill her shops and streets.</desc>
    <desc>Eternal Empire is a strict RP enforced MUSH with no mobs or other coded combat systems. Fights are up to the imagination of players and judges.</desc>

    <desc>The Kalandra Sector is one of the most densely populated regions in the Alpha Quadrant, with the native worlds of the Farians, the Galdorans, the Klaestron, the Kressari, the Trill, and a Federation colony on Caldik Prime. United for three centuries by a loose trading alliance, the sector had known peace for as long as the worlds in that sector had the capability to travel in space.</desc>
    <desc>This all began to change in the early 2300s.  A neighboring race known as the Tzenkethi started raiding the Trill System.  This continued for several months until the Trill were admitted into the United Federation of Planets.  In late 2310, the Tzenkethi started with even more raids.  With that, the Kalandra Interplanetary Coalition (referred to commonly as \"The Coalition\") was formed in March of 2316.</desc>
    <desc>By November 2325, the Coalition feared an invasion was imminent, and they sent out a call to the United Federation of Planets to provide assistance.  The fact that the Federation colony on Caldik Prime and the Federation member world of Trill were in the direct line of fire from Tzenkethi assaults forced their involvement.</desc>
    <desc>Along with the Coalition, it was determined that a central base of operations for starships would be required as the facilities at the Caldik Prime installation were not able to support increased starship traffic.  In May of 2327, construction was completed and the station was christened \"Delos Station.\"</desc>

The great city walls of Hidden Leaf were used to contain the bubbling unrest of its populace. Trying to act as common bound to their goals. To try and separate the old ways from the new. These walls were founded by the Great First Hokage. The city within was his legacy. Its creation an attempt to unite the clans and stop their blood shed to make the Land of Fire unbreakable. The mortar on the city street still not dry is our story. Where the first graduates from the Ninja Academy don their forehead protectors with the name of the Village. The clans make pity ruses to claim dominance of village. The young Genin are set free to shape this village. To make history and prove that concept of unity is right. This is our story.

    <desc>Zeldafront RPG Stone: Live the Legend! An online RPG made by-fans-for-fans and it's coming on the 1st of May!</desc>
    <desc>You can find the website (where you will be playing as well) at http://www.zeldafront.com/!</desc>
    <desc>If you wish to contact us, send an e-mail to atake@zeldafront.com.</desc>
    <desc>Development took a long time, and a total of 7 staff members have worked on it for a whole year. We have adjusted some things in the original story, to make it suitable for a perfect MMORPG!</desc>
    <desc>We used the atmosphere and world of Zelda, and adjusted it so everyone can play in it. This time, there won’t be just one or two storylines, there will be hundreds! And you can influence them all as a player!It all takes place in Hyrule, the Hyrule that starred in Ocarina of Time.</desc>
    <desc>This MMORPG isn’t just a normal game, it’s text-based. Meaning you get all the freedom you can get, and you can have your own character, in it’s own quest for it’s own goal. You write what you (=your character) does.</desc>
    <desc>Everything is interactive, since you decide what you do and what happens. Of course there are some rules,to make sure things won’t get out of hand.</desc>
    <desc>Players will have many things to do, such as just becoming a great warrior, or living in Kakariko Village as a carpenter. Or you could try to find a girlfriend and spend romantic evenings watching the stars above Lake Hylia, or... well, just think of somethingyourself!</desc>
    <desc>The regular and special Events are great fun for the players, and they can –sometimes- even earn a special item or other rewards. In this game you don’t just play to become strong, and there is no final ending. It’s about living your character’s life, and reaching your goal.</desc>
    <desc>We hope to attract many Zelda fans from all around the globe, and offer them the ultimate Zelda experience.</desc>
    <desc>Zeldafront RPG Stone: Live the Legend! * Fast server, quick connection * Shops with all of the items you had in Ocarina of Time. * Simple-to-use – easy-to-understand RP System. * Meet other players and start your epic adventures together! * Almost total freedom in what you do with your character. * Assistance is available 24/7! * Free!

    <desc>Eventide MUSH takes place in the sleepy and rain-laden town of Port Angeles, Washington, not so very far from the sleepy and rain-laden town of Forks. Aside from the seemingly safe and hip downtown environment the city provides, and breathtaking natural beauty of the surrounding area, there's something else to boast: it is home to the largest supernatural population in the US. While many people go about their lives oblivious about the town's darker side, others struggle to cope with knowing that outside of the questionably safe confines on their homes, vampires, werewolves, and shape-shifters blend in nearly seamlessly with society.</desc>
    <desc>Many vampires, however, are not content to blend in. There have been a tad too many murders and disappearances for a small, reverential town as of late - it's spurred some of nature's greatest protectors, the shifters and the werewolves, to action. Will their action be enough, or will it take a true uprising of heroes, partnering together with humanity to save the Olympic Peninsula?</desc>
    <desc>Eventide is loosely based on the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. The game explores an alternate to the route taken in the books, introducing a variety of paths for original character concepts and themes, including Children of the Moon (werewolves) and the possibility of other supernaturals. The theme provides unlimited possibilities. Every vampire is not bad - some aren't even murderers! Every wolf doesn't come from the nearby town of La Push, and every human is not a pawn.</desc>
    <desc>Features: * Mostly original characters with pre-made and feature characters available * Settings in Port Angeles, Forks, La Push, and Volterra * Extensive news files - no prior knowledge of the theme necessary * NPC code to try out the game before CharGen * Active playerbase with regularly-run TPs and PrPs * Statless, roleplay-based combat</desc>

    <desc>What more could you want in a game? Factions, NPCs, a well-described grid, friendly and experienced staff members, a brand new world to play in, change, and integrate yourself with, a rich and detailed setting, political intrigue, backstabbery, fetes and coronations, masques and balls. The potential is infinite. Even if you have never heard of the Kushiel's Legacy series, fret not -- our help and news files are large, easy to understand, and perfectly comprehensive and the Wiki is a perfect place to get started if you're new to MUXes or MUSHes.</desc>

    <desc>What is Shades of Truth? It is one of the most intense and in-depth online roleplaying games that has ever existed on the internet. If you enjoy \"hardcore roleplaying\" then this is one of the best games available for you to play. Taking place in a collectively shared Dreamstate, characters can determine the fate of an entire city. They can lead a House, study the nature of the world around them, battle forces that threaten the Dream, or become one of the most notorious villains in the City of Dream's history. The choice is entirely up to the player! There is no limit to the scope of the story the player wants to create while within the game. Shades of Truth is headed by a group of volunteers and is entirely 100% FREE to download and play. The current version of Shades of Truth is available for use while the project team develops and prepares the approaching release of an updated 3D client! So what are you waiting for? The City of Dreams awaits you!</desc>

The mud features basic manual combat, and a limited race and element selection at the moment. The mud is based on dystopia 1.4 and uses all custom areas and equipment, classes, races. With a player created combination system our mud is starting to develop. However, we are still in beta and the majority of our systems are not fully finished. We welcome players to come and try our game and tell us what you think. -Ivlin, Zemus The Four Towers</desc>

    <desc>The code base is heavily modified, updated with some of the latest snippets, including heavy original modifications. We have over 350 areas (30k rooms) and are always adding more original areas. We have clans and orders with equipment and areas also.</desc>
    <desc>NEW: A multi-dimensional ascii world map system. All our areas are connected to this system so that you now reach areas via the world map - complete with terrain, water, flying in the air, etc.</desc>

    <desc>Last weeks big news story involved Batgirl being kidnapped by Sabertooth only to be rescued by the mutant strikeforce known as Youngblood. Normally this story would be impossible as each of those involved belong to different dimensional realities. What if they weren't? What if these heroes, and the villains they fight, suddenly found themselves sharing not only a dimension or a single world but a single city? Imagine Spawn matching wits against the Joker or the X-Men having to muster their forces against the Cyborg Superman. In the universe of a place called Empire City anything is possible. Heroes are drawn from all over the multiverse and thrust into the city with no fanfare or preperation. One moment Batman is leaping from rooftop to rooftop chasing after Hush the next he's looking out at an unfamiliar skyline with no sign of his enemy in sight.</desc>
    <desc>Empire City could be called a 'blended universe' mux as we allow characters from pretty much any universe to be apped for and played in one unified setting. These characters didn't grow up in Empire City, however, they were drawn from their home realities and deposited here by something scientists have dubbed the infinity wave. Not only can players app characters from Marvel, DC, Image or where ever but they can take characters from any related multiverse as well. Want to play evil Beast from Age of Apocalypse? No problem. Want to play Hyperion from Earth-712? Go for it. Other than that we're very open. You can even create your own unique take on classic characters!</desc>
    <desc>Empire City is designed to welcome any character from comics but it also has its own unique flavor. The universe of Empire City is a bit darker than most. Our goal is to allow for a bit more 'adult' oriented RP. Think along the lines of The Killing Joke, Watchmen and the Maximum Power universes and you get the idea. Even our more 4 color areas have a grey tinge to them. Empire City is a universe where the villains are a bit more brazen, the public a bit more cynical and the heroes perhaps a bit more jaded. Each character is unique, however,and every player has the ability to outline their RP preferences listing what they are and are not comfortable with RP wise.</desc>
    <desc>Finally, while we are an RP based mux we do use the Mutants &amp; Masterminds roleplaying game to flesh out characters. This allows for a rapid application process and helps ensure 'equality' among the various denizens of the Empire universe.</desc>

    <desc>Kalith, spawned of darkness and that which 'is not' yet always there, Elestra, spawned of the abscess of the darkness in the formation of something that 'is'. The storyline is described in further detail in game, but the underlying theme is Kalith was what is and always has been where there is nothing. Elestra is a rogue spirit once servant to Kalith like all the other spirits, born of desire to be different and be more. So Elestra created the world, and Kalith decided it was a practical game and maintained the balance between his dark and her light until she was strong enough to hold her own with 'Father' Kalith. And so it became that the two geat beings over the world are Mother Elestra and Father Kalith, more power between the two of them than is imaginable, so the minor duties of safekeeping the world was left to minor dieties (which is why we need more immortals). Kalith chose his servants and vassal of power, and Elestra chose her helpers and keepers of good will. The balance is set.</desc>

    <desc>EdenMUSH is a social roleplaying mush set in a cyberpunk near-future similar to the world envisioned in William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. The majority of EdenMUSH is not centered around life on Earth however, but instead on the lives of those living and vacationing in the space habitat known as New Eden.</desc>
    <desc>New Eden is a Bernal sphere type space station, 223m in radius with an internal area of 630,210 square meters. The habitat supports as many as 9,000 - 10,000 residents and generates near-earth gravity along it's 'equator' by rotating along its central axis at 2rpm. Residents and visitors are afforded all the luxuries of earth-bound life, with amenities mirroring those of any similarly sized resort.</desc>
    <desc>With EdenMUSH it is hoped that the players are offered an interesting and exciting roleplaying environment, while still leaving room for expansion and growth based upon the ideas of the player's themselves.</desc>

    <desc>GTA-MUD is based on the GTA universe, and aims to allow the players to do everything they might have wanted to do in the game but couldn't.  In this game, gangsters, pimps and cops wander around a city looking for action.  You can walk around a living, breathing city doing whatever you want to do, as long as you're prepared to pay the consequences. Want to rob a bank? No problem as long as you don't mind the police being on your back. Want to help the police by being a bounty hunter? Don't expect your bounty to give himself up easily.  Want to just live a normal life?  Then keep out the way!</desc>
    <desc>The game is quite small at the moment, but that is partly intentional.  I'm trying to encourage as much inter-player communication as possible, and I don't want players to have to wander around thousands of rooms looking for someone else.</desc>
    <desc>I'm also trying to create an environment that has full cause-and-effect.  If you do something, like rob a bank, expect the police to be after you.  If you drink too much at the bar, expect to fall over.  And if you get into a fight, expect the local heavies to weigh in.</desc>

    <desc>Safekeep is a skill-based MUD with no levels or classes, featuring a semi-unique world, basic questing, and randomized items which appear in shops and drop randomly off of mobs. Characters may gain new skills, practice them, or train their core attributes from anywhere by using Character Points, which are gained from questing and from killing mobs. Quest items are extremely powerful but also random, creating a natural endgame for experienced characters.</desc>
    <desc>To use magic in Safekeep, players must gain \"school\" skills (evocation, restoration, etc.) to cast spells, and most spells must be learned by using the study skill on random scroll drops found in the game. Players may also gain a set of basic starter spells for a few Character Points.</desc>
    <desc>This MUD is currently in development but is stable, lag-free, and very addictive. We have only a handful of players, but the MUD is designed to be fun enough to play alone, so feel free to stop on by and check it out.</desc>

You dont choose a class, you choose the skills according to how much your brain can hold, and the class will be assigned to you.This works great for multi classing.</desc>
    <desc>The leveling system extends to 50, and upon there, you gain the ability to fuse with another player(mix both your genes and race) and restart at level 5, next generation (more powerful), being something you have never been before. This makes for endless replaying and customising. Note: This is NOT remort.</desc>
    <desc>During fusion any of the other players limbs and/or genes can be transferred to you and vice versa, but be careful, genes can also be lost. Stats and attributes will also increase or decrease accordingly. No two players will ever be the same.</desc>
    <desc>With the exception of standard weapon attacks, combat and spell casting time is not randomised, you employ full control of when you cast the next spell or strike the next hit through our unique action point system.</desc>

Upgrade abilities, boost talents, raise important stats and more. * Newbie friendly Admin staff and game information. There is much to learn, but everything is geared towards helping. * NPC trading system for passive item acquisition. * Random exploration events provide alternate leveling methods.</desc>

At Dragonball Z, The Edge of Chaos (DBZ EoC), we have a very active RP player base too and welcome any others who may want to experience a more immersive environment through the active storyline content. This is the first version of the Edge code and version 2 is just around the corner. We take pride in maintaining friendly players and a Immortal staff which will help guide you through the many fun quests we offer.  In this world the universes are colliding, leaving us on the Edge of Chaos.  This creates the ability for us to allow many different fantasy worlds on here as well. However, we are still primarily based on DBZ, so our themes will essentially revolve around those.

    <desc>Every morning the sun rises on Ellensburg, Washington - a flourishing town complete with a long-standing historical background, a flourishing tourist trade, and a thriving college within its all-American borders. Every morning, the school busses run, the college students sleep off hangovers, and the town gossips circulate the latest about racy middle-aged affairs that nobody actually wants to envision. In short, mornings in Ellensburg bring about normalcy...something the town has a bit of an /issue/ with at night.</desc>
    <desc>No, there's not much evidence of it, really. Sure, there have been an odd number of disappearances lately. And yeah, it can be a little creepy near the woods at night, but who goes out there anyway? Oh! And some of the elders in town sometimes tell stories about the town's mythical or magical past or something, but it's all talk. That's what they like to believe, anyway.</desc>
    <desc>In truth, Ellensburg is much more than the northwest's hundredth clone of Smalltown, USA. It's a meeting place for the outcasts of the daylight - the vampires, the werewolves, the ones with magical abilities. Maybe it's because of the high deposit of precious gems in the earth below the town, or the rich historical past, maybe not. It sure is something - a something that the residents have yet to discuss over the morning paper. Hold on, Ellensburg.</desc>
    <desc>Bloodlines is a MUSH set within the theme of the Vampire Diaries series. The game takes place in a different town without any of the characters from the series and is based mostly around college-aged characters. Original and creative concepts welcomed.</desc>

We are a classless mud with expertise based skill and spell system. You assign points (earned by leveling) into one of many different areas of expertise and can then learn skills and spells based on  your level of knowledge in that certain area of expertise (ie: Diablo II). We are also working on the ability to have Player controlled cities with an advanced economic system.</desc>

Kel-Moraine is under attack from several rival cities including Astoria and its Tyrant ruler.

    <desc>It was a time of peace and joyful endings for decades. Wars were unheard of in this realm until a strange man by the name of Yerte summoned a strange gate. He called this gate the Apocalyptic Gate.. The citizens gathered around the strange gate for days until one day it opened. As it opened a large demon exited the gate decapitating them one by one. The citizens cried for help as the fiend devoured them, but in the distance a howls could be heard. From out of nowhere a pack of black and white furred beasts came to assist the citizens. As they grew close more demons poured out of the gate. It was that time, the war had finally arrived. Awaken all creatures of the realm and take your side, but their can only be one champion.</desc>
    <desc>Apocalyptic Gate offers:</desc>
    <desc>Classes: Mage, Demon, Werewolf, Angel, Monk, Ninja, Fae, and Vampire.</desc>

We have redone many of the classic LOW4 classes and added new ones: Werewolf, Vampire, Drow, Monk, Ninja, Demon, Renshai, Necromancer, Ranger, Dragons, with Daggers, Guardians, and Highlanders almost complete.  We have subclassing which allows you to have more than one class on your pfile as well as 3 seperate endgame arenas.</desc>
    <desc>Clans have a chance each week to capture a fully upgraded castle and then have to defend it in the next week.  Status will be reset each month so there is always PK tobe had instead of people eventually quitting because noone in their range logs in.  Card questing has been taken out in favor of expmode which allows you to choose whether you gain exp or qp from mobs.</desc>

Rowling of the Harry Potter series. Set in the U.K. during the era of World War II, starting in the year 1935. This date is so that a buffer of time is given to the playerbase to get settled before WWII breaks out officially on September 1, 1939. The staff and player base is a warm family like community. ATM we have no HELP or NEWS files installed so we honestly aren't very newbie friendly. Those who are familiar with WoD MUs should hopefully feel at home. The magic system is very much in construction mode, mostly being tested in tabletop. It will combine elements of the Mage and Changeling magic systems, re-worked to have a more Harry Potter feel. Though we use the Storyteller System and have alot of the same races at first glance. Don't be fooled this is not a WoD game set in the UK pretending to be a Harry Potter setting. The world is J.K. Rowling not World of Darkness. Please keep in mind the game is under development so come with a play testers spirit and a willingness to help build the game. ----------------================(@v@)================-----------------</desc>

    <www>http://www.psychonook.com/vp/index.htm</www>
    <desc>VirtuaPern exists approximately 800+ turns after the Ninth Pass. We're working under the assumption that all the things in the book /did/ happen though AIVAS was more damaged than believed, thus causing a few calculation errors in the plan to push the Red Star out of orbit, and from there... the story continues. After the death of Robinton, things took a rather morose turn.  With such tragedy hanging over Landing, people gradually drew away from AVIAS and it's knowledge.  Pern never reaches the level of technology that the Colonists had originally set up except for some minor advancements in the medical technology and for some over improvements in living conditions at Hold and Weyr. The Weyrs having fulfilled it's plans to eradicate Thread, fight out the rest of the Pass, but with the eventual death of F'lar and the greatly decreasing sizes of dragon clutches, the Weyrs only made a partial attempt to settle in the South at Honshu and Eastern Weyr. Over the next 450 turns the Weyrs diminish as the number of new dragons never exceeded the number of existing dragons, to the point where now in the present only two Weyrs are still open, the rest moving to Fort and Benden to make only two full sized Weyrs. It was during the celebration of the 3rd Millennium that the Weyrleader of Benden, V'lin of bronze Chendath decided to once again bring attention to dragonkind by renaming the Weyr after one of the orbiting colony ships forming the Dawn Sisters: Bahrain. He wished to revitalize the Weyr against the demoralization of the decreasing dragon population and to celebrate the anniversary of Landing, believing that the great ships did far more for Pern than just one single man who captained them. Despite the change, the riders continued to fall into disfavor and most folk, riders included, still call it Benden. The Holds spread out further, many minor Holds growing in large sizes to the point where they almost match the size of the old major Holds.  Though some still tithed to the last two Weyrs, the majority felt that they were a drain on the growing economy. In fact, tensions grew intolerable in the current generation, to the point where a rift grew between Fort Hold and Weyr, the conflict extending to encompass the other Holds and Weyr.  Tithes were withheld and finally situation grew intolerable to the Bahrain Weyrleaders, so they packed up and established Xanadu Weyr in the depths of the Southern Continent beside the Sea of Azov.  With them came Crafters and Holders who still believed in upholding the dragonfolk.  Thus Xanadu Hold was built beside the new Weyr as well as several new halls for Smith, Weaver, and Beastcraft. Earthquakes and volcanic activity as well as an unusually severe monsoon season made many of the areas once reclaimed from the Southern Continent's jungle uninhabitable. Refugees began to flood into Xanadu Hold and Weyr, many voicing the opinion that they would all be much better off returning North and to their traditional homes. With the growing population in such a small area and the pressure to feed and house so many, the decision was made to give into the demands and move as many as wished to go back to the Northern Continent. Benden Weyr-for the name and its past has been reclaimed- once again houses a full compliment of riders, and the Red Star still hovers over the horizon, each turn drawing closer and closer.  Rumors that the clutches at the Weyrs are growing in size and frequency as riders once again fly out to Search outside the Weyr and that Thread might fall again.  Only time will tell...</desc>

    <desc>Each enemy has their own level system, so a level 1 snake, will never be as easy to kill as a level 1 Blood Orc. You need to watch what is going on before you fight them.</desc>

    <desc>It has been a hard-fought battle, but the fledgling NEW REPUBLIC has won several major victories over its enemies in rapid succession. Grand Admiral Thrawn has been defeated. Admiral Daala has been removed from the Maw Installation and the super-weapon research there has been halted.  Even the resurrected Emperor has been destroyed for all time, consumed by the Dark Side. The Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker has set up a Jedi Academy on the world of YAVIN IV, and many candidates are stepping forward to join the ranks of the New Jedi Knights, to help usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for the citizens of the galaxy.</desc>
    <desc>But the darkness has not passed fully. Remnants of the EVIL GALACTIC EMPIRE are even now marshalling their forces and consolidating power around  the Imperial stronghold world known as BASTION.  Lead by Admiral Daala and Vice-Admiral Pellaeon, the Imperial war machine seeks to regain lost territory and reestablish its former glory. But even more disturbing, there have been stirrings on the old Sith world of KORRIBAN. The seductive call of the Dark Side of the Force is being heard by many would-be Sith Masters who are following its siren's voice to a new destiny...</desc>
    <desc>UNSUNG HEROES is set in the Star Wars universe roughly eight years after the destruction of the second Death Star at Endor, just a short while after the events of th Jedi Academy novel series. While the Feature Characters of Star Wars (Luke, Leia, Han, etc.) are still around, they are NPC 'background' characters.  It could be that your character may run into or interact with one of these feature characters, but we focus on the heroic (or evil!) pursuits of the players' characters and not on the feature characters of the Star Wars universe.</desc>
    <desc>Some features of the game: * Force Users (Jedi, Sith, or Non-Aligned) are available by open application.</desc>
    <desc>* You can play up to four different characters, two of which can be 'special' characters such as Force users or characters who are in leadership roles.</desc>
    <desc>* While our primary focus is roleplay, we have fully coded skill, space, and combat systems:  For those times when talking just isn't going to get the job done!</desc>

    <desc>Threads of Time : A Carpathian Tapestry</desc>
    <desc>Treachery, like fine wine, flows freely though the halls of power. And where soft words conspire, sharp steel waits just out of sight, like a dagger beside a goblet of gold. The Eastern European Renaissance is a banquet of such delights, and a person who would share tables with rich and highborn folk had better keep his own wine and daggers close at hand.</desc>
    <desc>'Threads of Time' offers adventures in a genre that is epitomized by courtly backgrounds, conspiracy, high stakes, grand style, rapid swordplay, daring deeds, binding honor and a fair helping of seduction. These adventures have a flavor all their own, a heady mix of style, trickery and graceful violence. Although such adventures can take place anywhere, it is only in the Renaissance Era one is at home in and around the court. Any muscle can hack and slash his way across a battle field, but the delicate gamesmanship and sudden reversals of highborn politics demands quick wits and a ready blade. More time then night, you cannot just pull out a sword and kill your foe in court or manor. Such matters must be handled with more... delicacy... than force. Which is not to say that such matters is not deadly Au contraire! Where a soldier gambles with his own fate in a single combat, the courtier or merchant prince tosses the dice with dozens, sometimes hundreds or even thousands of lives. It is not a game for fools or cowards, but can be more rewarding than a pile of gold coins - if you live to collect the rewards, that is.</desc>
    <desc>This weaving of art, commerce, technology, religious conflict, moral and sexual licenses and political intrigue sets this era apart from the other's tapestries. Add to that, the anti- heroes themselves - dark, evil figures whose passions are no longer human. The Undead, Lycanthropes and witches lend to the weavings a dark horror steeped with fear and sensuality; the heart beats in time with the tapping of a talon on the window pane, a victim feels the fangs of a vampiress pressing into his neck he feels them denting his flesh, even before they pierce the skin and the low, mournful howl in the copse rises to a feverish pitch. Tangled yards of thread, spun to create a world wide tapestry - the weaving of seduction, intrigue, assassination and villainy most vile.</desc>
    <desc>In this setting, we use the tools that White Wolf has provided us in the 'World of Darkness' with a mixture of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons' Ravenloft theme and our own imagination to create a world that is weaved uniquely into...</desc>

    <desc>2343 Before the Destruction of the Enterprise-C at Narenda III Space, the Final Frontier. With these words, one of the great TV shows of the modern era was launched. This show was Star Trek, which forms the base history of Star Trek: Yesterday's Voyages. We are set in what has been dubbed one of 'The Lost Eras', between the Khitomer Accords and thelaunch of the USS Enterprise-D. To be more precise, we're set in 2343, a full twenty years before the launch of that great ship. The Dominion is unheard of, the Borg are but a rumour, and a great age of adventure is taking place.</desc>
    <desc>The three powers we focus on are the United Federation of Planets, the Romulan Star Empire, and the Klingon Empire. On the fringes of known space are a variety of powers, both major (such as the Cardassian Union, discovered by the Federation eight years ago), and minor.</desc>

    <desc>In year 2010, the world has changed. Astral bodies falling from space strike the Earth to devastating results. The impacts do not cause many deaths, but dust from impact is thrown up into the air, the inhalation of which decimates the population. As scientists begin to study these fallen rocks, they become increasingly aware that the world has changed. It seems that this stardust can warp the very fabric of reality.</desc>
    <desc>As the years pass, strange phenomena become more accepted. Things that were once thought mere fantasy became real. Wizards able to command the elements come forth and show the world that human will can shape the world. Aliens come to Earth to study these mysterious objects (and apologize for all of those illicit abductions). Arco brings forth technology that has only been seen in science fiction. Some born after impact become innately able to do the impossible.</desc>
    <desc>Fast forward to 2038, New Ashenham, the epicenter of all this weirdness. Arco is still running, trying to capture rogue Starborn and run experiments. The Remnants of the devastated city are partially rebuilt, but the surrounding Wasteland is still hostile and wild, filled with gangs and rogues. The 12th sphere meets in secret to decide when and where they will meddle with these changing affairs. HARM maintains the peace with several alien ambassadors. The Incendiary Order brings forth their fiery brand of justice. And sinister things lurk, enabled by all these strange phenomena, ready to tip the balance and bring chaos to all inhabitants of the area.</desc>

    <desc>We have active coders and builders on staff, generating about one new area a month.  New skills and spells are added all the time. We are a long way from the original Icey Depths 0.9 codebase we started with.  The game mechanics get more complex all the time.</desc>

    <desc>Once upon a time, there was a majestic world where magic flourished and the mythical became real. Brave hearts and pure souls roamed this land, and it was called Filgaia. Then the discovery of Elw artifacts led to the uncovering of peculiar items dubbed \"ARMs\"...devices capable of killing with a mere gesture. These objects quickly spread across the world, and covered Filgaia in blood and gold. While there were men and women who could wield these mysterious artifacts without ill sentiment, for the majority of the population, there was nothing but greed and the thirst for power--power which came from wielding the most powerful weapons ever seen. Heroes and villains clashed, battles passed into legend, towns crumbled to time and cities arose in their place. Civilization bettered itself technologically, and at the same time, the entropy which fed on the guns unearthed in Elw ruins deteriorated it.</desc>
    <desc>Over the years, Filgaia saw an explosion of crime, and the great emergence of outlaws and bounty hunters, and from the ashes of peace sprang a war the likes of which the world had never seen. ARMs grew prolific while the presence of magic dwindled away until even the memories became myth. Some said those who could use magic had sealed themselves away in another world to escape the escalating violence of their environment...others claimed that magic had merely lost potency in the face of the almighty ARM. There were even rumors that the Guardians themselves, the deities of the main religion of Filgaia, had abandoned them in their darkest hour. A shadow passed over the world, and mankind mourned the loss of its innocence.</desc>
    <desc>Then one day, rumors began about the sudden appearance of those who could use magic, and stories of grotesque monsters wandering the desert....</desc>

    <desc>A two grid game that is all about comic books and comic characters from the DC and Marvel universes. The DC game is to provide new twists to old characters and give flexibility and chances to apply adapted Feature Characters. The Marvel game is to give the chance to play favorite Feature Characters without the weight of heavy and too complicated histories. It is also meant to make it easy to write in characters that haven't appeared yet in the early timeline. Furthermore, both games are being built to be OC friendly. We opened officially on April 16, 2010.</desc>
    <desc>Marvel: In The Beginning...</desc>
    <desc>This is a Marvel game that starts at a sort of 'year one'. The X-Men have only be active for about a year or so, having just a skeleton crew. Xavier has grand plans however as he searches desperately for teachers and students alike to make Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters a true haven. Iron Man is the bodyguard of the infamous Tony Stark, the playboy and trouble maker. Still, Iron Man has started to do more than just protect Stark Industries; he is doing truly heroic things. Even he feels the anger build at the injustice of it all, and is thinking about doing something about it. Yet, what can he do alone?</desc>
    <desc>SHIELD is an international organization that is in the beginning stages under the U.N. influence. Nick Fury was beyond shocked at what was built before him, and as he places his hands on the reins it is only just in time before the world seems to explode. The Friends of Humanity is becoming more terrorists than activist group, developing a bad name even in the public eye. Yet the fear is growing as mutants and super-powered individuals appear. Just wait till the aliens start to arrive!</desc>
    <desc>DC: The Guardians</desc>
    <desc>This is an else-world, where many things are different or just a little off. Selina Kyle is the owner of Kyle Enterprises and secretly prowls at Catwoman. Batman has been dead for a few years, a murderer and thief, as well as the dead husband to Selina Kyle. Superman has left Earth for New Krypton, leaving a grown Superboy to step into his shoes as Superman. Green Arrow continues to make her mark, proving that Robin Hood should have been born female. After the destruction of the JSA, the government is finally overturning their anti-superhero ruling thanks to the continued brave efforts of heroes like Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern and Hawkman. Stepping forward, Catwoman is now putting out a call to found the Justice League though many of the old heroes are finally turning in their uniforms for retirement. Who will take up their mantels to honor them?</desc>

    <desc>The game is well developed with dozens of totally original areas that you will not find on any other mud. All of the areas relate to the Dragon Realms world and its story. The game heavily emphasises roleplaying, rather than hack-n-slash. Most areas have challenging quests.</desc>
    <desc>Dragon Realms differs from many other MUDs because of its focus on roleplay. It attempts to create the experience of table top roleplaying games, in an online environment.</desc>

    <desc>The Cortex - An unending stream of information, flowing through the 'Verse. Data, images, pictures, money, lives.  All affected by the ebb and flow of the Waves floating across the Black. It has been five years since the events of 'Serenity'.  Life goes on for the citizens of the 'Verse, much as before.  Ships fly, their owners keeping themselves free and in the skies.  Ranchers Farm, and Soldiers patrol the spacelines.  Life in the Core is serene and peaceful.  Life on the Rim is hard, but the rewards are still there. As for that broadcast?  Well, Alliance says it was just a hoax, a bad piece of propaganda from some Browncoat sympathizers, holdouts from the War. Sure, 'twas an amusing piece of tall tale, but them Reavers ain't human.  No way, no how.  Certainly, not even the Alliance could be that Evil. --- The Cortex is an open RPG server, where players can roleplay out life in Joss Whedon's Firefly/Serenity Universe.  Five years after \"The Signal\" was sent out, the 'Verse still has plenty of adventure for the people who want to reach out and grab it. The Cortex uses a unique RP-based Economy.  The more you RP, and the more RP you generate for others, the more Karma you generate for yourself, allowing you to control a bit of the 'Verse.  Karma can be used to acquire equipment, vehicles, or even your own Spaceship, as well as many other activities. A simple skill-based system allows for the guidance and resolution of conflicts, allowing players to not have to worry about 'stat buffing'. The FreeFORM2 RPG System is designed for high adventure, as well as small character-interaction-based roleplay.</desc>

We here at MT love ANSI graphics and provide a unique coloring display designed to enhance your playing experience. You can also do much more than hack and slash, we incorporate mob classification and random items are dropped that can be used in certain trade skills and quests.

Any player that completes the quests is rewarded with experience points as well as beginner equipment.

    <desc>HeroMUD is based in the fantasy world of Eluna, a huge planed filled with life of all shapes and sizes. 18 major cities span 12 countries and 3 continents. Some countries are peace-loving republics and other countries are power-hungry dictatorships, while yet other countries cover everything in between. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HeroMUD puts world-changing decisions in the player's hands. 3 main story lines hold endless possibilities for the world of Eluna. 1.)  As two countries wage war, the player must choose which country to side with and which country to oppose. Or the player can choose to remain neutral in the war, and watch the warring countries tear each other apart. 2.)  Cataclysmic events are occuring all across Eluna. Long dormant volcanoes have begun to erupt again, the trees have begun to sing a song of mourning, and the stones of Eluna have begun to rattle under the feet of man. The race is on to uncover the source of these events and, if possible, put an end to that source. 3.)  Reports of pirate attacks have begun coming in at an ever increasing rate. The Port Authority, based in Vorrell City (the capital of the strictly neutral country of Vorrell), have almost completely shut down ocean travel. Eluna's seaports are outraged and have begun hiring mercenaries to deal with the Pirate menace. In order to deal with the mercenary threat, the Pirate clans have begun to enlist new members in their ranks. Which side will be victorious? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Though HeroMUD is but a fledgling MUD and wholy unfinished, the staff at HeroMUD work vigilantly to increase the size of Eluna. As of the post date, the world is hardly habitable. Perspective builders and coders are more than welcome to stop by and have a look.</desc>

    <desc>It is the end of an era. The evil tyrant Scar has been overthrown, and the dry season has passed. The Pridelands are once again a rich paradise, and King Simba and Queen Nala have begun their rightful rule in a time of peace - with a pair of lovely new cubs. The Circle of Life is complete once more.</desc>
    <desc>However, not all is perfect under the sun. Beyond the northern borders, the shadowy places look more menacing than ever. The Graveyard hyenas have lost their reign over the lush Pridelands, betrayed by their former ally, and they've got a bone to pick with Simba. And with the death of Scar, a new queen has risen among the ranks of his followers who were banished to the barren Outlands with only one thing on her mind - revenge.</desc>
    <desc>Following the majesty of the original film, The PrideLand Chronicles MUCK begins where The Lion King left off, allowing for an open slate for the continuation of the stories and characters of the Pridelands. Will Zira succeed in her vengeful mission, or is Kovu destined to fall in love with Kiara? Will you play a happy Pridelands cub, a disgruntled hyena, or perhaps even one of the original movie characters? The choice is yours!</desc>

The ground has been churned and spoiled, stained red and green from battle. Hacked and bloody corpses litter the landscape like broken dolls, and five weary figures emerge, victors perhaps. Five explorers from five different walks of life, with five different allegiances, become comrades in arms from necessity. Exhausted from battle, injured, their magical reserves low, they cautiously explore this land. Heliav, Spyro, Valerian, Kaji, and Sheean, a motley crew at best.

    <desc>Formerly known as ChronoMUCK, our game's world was expanded beyond the simple world of Chronos. It is now a massive number of fully conceived worlds with Twisted Street as it's hub.  Players can create characters and live out their lives on worlds and universes complete with rich histories and unique locations, or go out and discover the vast existence around them. Twisted is a place where worlds and universes connect and almost anything can happen.  However, it's not all a free ticket. Certain worlds are isolated until they reach a level where they can join the rest of the multi-verse. Characters traveling back and forth between these worlds have to deal with forces like TASK, who dedicate themselves to preserving the integrity of these worlds to keep contamination to a minimum.

    <desc>Hrielith is an all-orginal world, lovingly handcrafted during over 45,000 man hours of development. We are huge role-playing enthusiasts, and encourage as well as reward imaginative role-playing. Our system is unique, and very engaging, allowing for in-room movement, which adds new dimensions to combat and exploration. We offer a wonderful and supportive player environment, and will reward common players who role-play well with homes in the primary city. Hrielith's plot is deep and unique, as you will see when you examine the player guide and story pages. High-fantasty RP in a carefully handcrafted environment gives you the opportunity to deeply explore your own role-playing passions!</desc>
    <desc>We encourage new players, and have a long history of supporting text-based environments over image-based environments because the text-based model actually -encourages- imagination and role-playing.</desc>
    <desc>We look forward to seeing you online, and would be very excited to hear from those interested in joining our project as players, immortals, builders, or coders.</desc>

    <desc>Between Darkness and Light MUX (BDnL) The year is 2005, and the world that surrounds you is not far removed from that which you see around you every day. International concerns like terrorism, global warming, ecological and economic dangers and disasters shape everything and everyone. Many look to the supposed glory of days past, and strive to recreate those times in a new climate, though they have little chance of success. Every individual is faced with the dilemna of choosing whether to embrace hope and strive for a better world, or to embrace the grit of realism and simply make due with the often shabby and sometimes painful truths of a world that can never live up to those ideals.</desc>
    <desc>It has been decades since the world last saw those who dared to stand apart and try to change the course and fabric of humanity and history. Those who called themselves 'heroes' and 'heroines' ... and those who have been named by history as 'villains'. These figures who stood larger than life faded into obscurity, becoming little more than modern myth and legend despite the very real truth of their presence. And yet, rumors abound now, far more loudly than since the dark days of Hitler's rise to power long ago. Those rumors hint that other men and women, with powers and abilities beyond those of normal mortals, have returned to the world. And some are those who believe that it is these figures who may yet shape the next age of mankind.</desc>
    <desc>It is a world torn between the Darkness and the Light. Which side will you choose?</desc>
    <desc>BDnL MUX is a superheroic roleplaying environment,  based on a near-real world, and including within its fabric characters from DC, Marvel, and other comics as well as selected other sources. We are starting with New York as our main campaign city, but we are open to expanding the grid to include other cities (including Gotham, Metropolis, Washington DC, and others) as the playerbase grows to support that expansion. Newly opened, most all of the Featured Characters are open for application, and we also strongly encourage original characters.</desc>

    <port>5000</port>
    <www>http://lotj.wolfpaw.net</www>
    <desc>The Hapes Consortium on LotJ Decades ago, the Lorell Raiders roamed the space routes, seizing Republic vessels and ransacking Republican worlds. Among the wealth stolen were select woman who were the most beautiful and tallented of the human race. Having deposited the women on their hidden planet, the Lorell Raiders would leave for great lengths at a time to continue their raiding and pirating. The Captive women grew independent, and began to crave their freedom. In time, they would come to plot and scheme against their captors, finding ways to relay messages to the core worlds and enlist the aid of outsiders in their fight for independence.</desc>
    <desc>When the women were finally victorious over the oppresive Raiders, they formed the Hapes Consortium, a government ruled by women who vowed never to allow a man to rule over them again. They started out in ships left over from the uprising, and searched the Transitory Mists, combing every sector to see what else the pirates might have been hiding. To their delight, they found many planets with temperate atmospheres, all bearing natural resources and wealth beyond their wildest imaginations. The Hapan people divided themselves up into various houses from Royal, to Noble to Honorable, and settled themselves throughout the worlds. Over time, they developed allies, and made enemies amongst themselves in their persuits to advance themselves and their families. While the threat from the Lorell Raiders was gone, their offspring flourished, secretly seeking dominance.</desc>
    <desc>A note from the Staff: The Hapes Consortium is a game within a game on Legends of the Jedi. The Consortium operates on an RP style that can best be described as a mix between a mush and a mud. The Hapes Consortium on LotJ is ideal for Star Wars and science fiction fans who enjoy the detailed storyline of a mush, and the action and adventure of a mud. The Hapes Consortium on LotJ is an adult only area where RP storylines are generally unrestricted. For this reason, an age minimum of 18 has been established. If you are younger than 18 years of age please consider our main game, Legends of the Jedi which operates on the same port. We are a player kill environment, but we require all player kills to be supported with a strong, well conceived RP cause.  Restores are issued for any kill that does not meet the RP standards as determined by our player-elected Role Play Council (RPC).</desc>
    <desc>Our Statistical Data is more accurately displayed below: - We are an SWR codebase, operating the HC on LOTJ as a blend between a MUSH and a MUD. - LotJ hosts up to 80 players at a time during evening, EST hours. The Hapes Consortium is expected to see between 5 and 15 players during evening EST hours.</desc>

    <desc>Currently in our testing phase, Star Wars Erotica plans on taking it's MUD to new heights. We are a dedicated Star Wars Mud, with a little extra flare. And I’m sure you can tell what that flare is, just from reading our name. Of course, like all muds..we have an abundance of races and classes from which to choose from. There are many clans for which you can join and experience many new things.</desc>
    <desc>Atlhough there will be the normal RP (such as emote and the like), we have implemented a new channel of sorts, which is the Erotic RP channel or EP for short. You can use this channel to RP slavery, torture, and..the like. Or you can just use other channels, whichever you prefer. Should you wish to e-mail or notify us of these RP sessions, you will receive RP points. With these points, you can purchase things such as Special Equipment, Ships, and even your very own Asteroids which consist of around 20 rooms.</desc>
    <desc>Because we are RP Enforced, it is required that you create for yourself both a biography and a description if you are over level 20.</desc>
    <desc>While we are a flexible mud, we do not tolerate harassment and the act of forcing another OOCly to do something they do not wish to.</desc>
    <desc>We are currently hiring people who are interested in being an Immortal (Buidling, Coding, and Enforcing). If you wish to become an Immortal, please either log onto the mud and make a request directly, or send us an e-mail.</desc>
    <desc>We are also open to as well as welcome new ideas and suggestions that you may have for us. Or if you require further information on our mud or have anything else to say, please email us or log on.</desc>

    <ip>66.218.52.112</ip>
    <www>http://www.playerkill.com/</www>
    <desc>Ultraviolence is a pure player kill mud. Medieval ideas of levels, classes, and races are completely dispensed with and replaced with guns, explosives, and a focus on pure violence and destruction. Players log on and are randomly assigned to a blue or red team. The objective is to capture the flag of the opposing team, killing members of the opposite team who get in your way while avoiding being killed. Players navigate a randomly generated maze filled with weapons, ammunition, bombs, and random mobiles and other players out to kill you. Once the goal is achieved (the flag is captured) the game resets. While the game is conceptually simple, there is a deeper level of strategy beneath the surface. Whether you choose to focus on playing as a lone warrior with a big gun or a suicide bomber out to take as many with you as you can is up to you.</desc>
    <desc>Ultraviolence is based in design on a much older game called Ground Zero, although it was recoded from scratch. Source code for the game will be ultimately available.</desc>

    <desc>This mud is newly launched, most every bug squashed but certainly not bug free by any means. I am opening my doors for player testing right now but I'm not against players casually role playing and developing planets for the future of the mud. I strongly believe in the potential behind SWR 2.0 and I hope to find others like minded in the future. Come make this mud your place to call home as I have and endure the hardships of killing hordes of aliens as they attack planets, join a clan and soldier on through the ranks killing the foul scourge that plagues each planet every so often. Become an architect and shape the very landscape you walk on, or a weapon smith and create better and more deadly weapons for soldiers to mow down aliens with. Assassinate the leader of some other clan or take on a bounty and track them down across the galaxy gloriously severing their head from their body. Many opportunities can arise in a world completely player created you just have to show up and contribute your part to the cause or simply add to the role playing atmosphere if you feel you don't have a creative bone in your body. In any case you are bound to have fun whatever you decide to do!</desc>

    <desc>All is not lost for the rebellion though, as support for the rebels grows by the day amongst those who have felt the cold oppression of the Empire as it tries to maintain order.

    <desc>	The world used to be a paradise. The sages say everyone had plenty of food, and robots that served their every need, from cleaning to picking the fleas off of people. No one was ever sad, as wondrous medicine kept everyone happy. Coke, Pepsi, Starbucks, and the rest of the pantheon of gods watched over everyone, but every person were as gods themselves. This came to an end. No one remembers precisely how. Most agree there was a war, even though nobody know what it was fought over, or who participated in it, but what precisely ended it all remains a mystery. Weapons of mass destruction? Climate changes? Massive pollution? Robot or genetically engineered slave rebellion? Terrorists? Crazy artificial intelligence? Invading aliens? No one knows, although it's pretty certain it featured some really awesome explosions. 	Even so, there were survivors. Nobody knows how long ago the apocalypse took place, but the world has begun to heal. A few cities have even been formed, and technological progress is finally being made once again. Why, your grandfather might remember a time when people had to hunt with bow and arrow, but this new fangled black powder is really the bee's knees. Even so, the world hasn't escaped the ravages of the End yet. Pure humans are few, with a far greater amount of mutants around, but even sentient plants and animals exist. Artifacts from the Ancients still appear from time to time, bringing with them wealth and prosperity or death and destruction.</desc>
    <desc>Welcome to Gamma World. 	We're a new MUX based on Gamma World 4th Edition. The first real post apocalyptic RPG to be published, inspiring many of the RPGs and CRPGs that followed. Still, you youngsters can just think of it as \"you know, sorta like Fallout.\" The MUX is centered around Glowtown, a town near the nation of Bonparr. You can play a pure human, altered human, mutated animal or a sentient plant. Venture into the wasteland to encounter metaphors of the dangers of technological progress, and then shoot them for XP and domar.</desc>

    <desc>Twelve years ago, reality came crashing down around our respective ears.  All of our ears. And never stopped. Thousands of possible universes merged; forming a new reality. A vast world, composed of countless millions of Earths and other worlds linked from horizon to horizon; oceans and jungles the size of planets, and new and incomprehensible laws of physics at every turn. But such drastic changes do not come without social upheaval, plunging the world into a war between two supernations. The Union, dedicated to preserving the rights of its citizens, and the Confederacy, determined to unite all of existence under a single flag. Its own flag, of course.</desc>
    <desc>Multiverse Crisis MUSH is open for applications. A multi-theme environment which allows most series, including non-canon variants, to be applied for. Using a power-scaling system which levels out the playing field, television, anime, video games, books, movies and more are all allowed. Come and pick up the character you've always wanted, pick up an original character, or feel free to explore the concepts of 'what if' within a series. If you're tired of what's out there, want something interesting and new, want an active RP community, or want to bring your unique or underused theme or idea to light, give us a try.</desc>

    <desc>UPDATE: November 2009 - WE'RE BACCCKKKK</desc>
    <desc>After a rather extended hosting struggle, we're back in business. We're looking for coders and builders to help us get this MUSH started. -- Welcome to Star Trek: A Fury Unleashed.</desc>
    <desc>This is not your typical TrekMUSH. We cater to the... less noble... among us and the deviant inside of us.</desc>
    <desc>Starfleet now polices the quadrant's warp corridors, struggling to bring back the glory days of free passage and grand exploration. Independents -- some with good and some with bad -- intentions roam the galaxy, flaunting Starfleet's perceived authority.</desc>
    <desc>Our philosophy promotes heavier use of space and econ systems, combined with heavier interaction between factions, alliances, and organizations.</desc>
    <desc>To thrive on your own here you MUST understand that there is a risk. More space traffic and more fractured population groups means more chance for combat, argument, and debate, which we hope you interpret as enjoyment. Other TrekMUSHes can be sterile at times with lots of downtime, minimal risk, and TPs that all feel the same. Here we want you to create your own MP (Mega Plot) and do what YOU want to do and have other people adapt around it. Let chaos run rampant... everybody deserves to have fun and break out of the box that typical faction admins constrain them to.</desc>

    <desc>A Features of Godwars: Saints from Shadows</desc>
    <desc>*Classes include hellhound, dark elf, highlander, monk, mage, dragon, ninja, werewolf</desc>
    <desc>*Most classes have been recoded all new angel coming soon as well as others yet to be disclosed.</desc>
    <desc>*Classes are expanded with a remort system that allows you to gain all skills from up to 6 classes.</desc>
    <desc>This makes pk based more on skill rather than just chosing the right class. It inherently balances the game. And because status is required to remort this also encourages pk.</desc>
    <desc>*Forge system that allows players to use ore and gems to make some of the best equipment.</desc>
    <desc>*Training cells with trainmode, allows players to train without fear of pk.</desc>
    <desc>*Legend system build your characters damcap and ammount of attacks with legend.</desc>
    <desc>Legend requires quest points as well as status. Encourages both pk and questing this gives players other things to do than just hack and slash.</desc>
    <desc>*Recently added kingdoms</desc>
    <desc>*Active and experienced imm and coding team.</desc>

    <desc>It is not known exactly how many thousand warheads detonated throughout the world. Humankind and much of the earth descended into a dark age like no other.</desc>
    <desc>Only about 10 percent of the population has survived, however another species has arisen: Mutants. Such as the name suggests they were once indeed humans, however as generations began to pass.. It began doubtful that the two could co-exist peacefully.</desc>
    <desc>In the middle of this survival between two species, a city located where Phoenix used to be, (Now called New Phoenix, or 'The Dome') as referenced by its large polycarbonate lead-lined glass geo-dome.</desc>
    <desc>It is a place where humans did not have to adapt to the radiation but society indeed has changed... a virtual bee hive, each human given a task, each recieving all that they need to survive.</desc>
    <desc>Outside the Dome lies Survivors, those who drift the desert looking for a better life, resistant against the radiation, due to their unique genes.</desc>
    <desc>This is an original theme based on many of those games and movies that we love. Fallout, Judge Dredd, and Mad Max are all represented. Come join us. We are currently under construction, mostly for the combat/stat system.</desc>

    <desc>Interested in an open chargen nWoD game? Check out Novo Upanje. Not only is it open CG, it is even an open setting. PCs drive the setting's direction. Staff won't step in to protect a city from invaders, nor will staff step in and create peace. This World of Darkness is what you, the player, create. If it is a dark world with the various races at war with one another then it will be that way as players create this sort of World. If it is a World in which mortals globally discover they are not alone, then it will be due to player's actions working to expose the truth. No easy feat, but here on Novo Upanje anything is possible.</desc>
    <desc>We even allow players to create new settings. What you see is not all that exists. If you have a vision of an nWoD setting, add it -- a new city, a park, whatever. How successful or large it becomes depends on you! Now after it is built, the Staff takes over the maintenance for the setting, so that everything remains in line with the rest of the game. This opens up the possibilities of settings to the imagination of all the players and allows the game to grow.</desc>

Prodigy Academy is meant to be a drama, for you anime fans, think Please Save my Earth rather than Fist of the North Star or Dragonball. In other words, yeah, there's violence occasionally, but the point is how the students cope with their day to day lives in such an awful atmosphere. If you're logging in only to find yourself in bench clearing brawls or student rebellions every day, there's something wrong. And for those of you with an inkling to cause things like that, remember, the true point of a muck is to cultivate a good story, not prove your character is the best at everything.</desc>

    <desc>'STAR WARS: Dark Horizons' is a MUSH dedicated to roleplaying just before and during the Clone Wars era of the Star Wars universe.  Its canon is that of Episodes IV, V and VI as theatrically released.  The prequels and the Extended Universe materials may be used as inspiration, but are not considered canon.  Final say belongs to the wizards. SW:DH's dynamic roleplay environtment is supplemented by a robust code that includes a fully functioning IC economy that allows anything from weapons to ships to be bought or sold by players.  Everything is then tied into a unique combat system that includes the aforementioned ships and weapons as well as personal armor, ground vehicles, etc. 'STAR WARS: Dark Horizons' is a growing, newbie-friendly game that intends to play out Episodes I, II and III the way they should have been.</desc>

Legend tells of a time before Crossroads existed, when the Lord of the Abyss ruled the land and the seas and the people were naught but slaves to its will. Demons, giants, dragons, ghouls, and creatures too dark to imagine feasted on men, fouling the very land on which they stood and enslaving all life. It was a time of torment, a darkness from which rose a Champion, blessed by Providence to defeat the evil that ravaged the lands.</desc>

We DO need people to help testing, however, so if you think you can help, feel free to drop a mail. Now, on to the description.</desc>
    <desc>What we plan to do with Evolution Online is to make a completely unique world that allows the players to shape their own destiny. It's a world filled with magic, and it has always been so, thus resulting in uniquely evolved races and many bizarre and strange creatures. The players will start off at the dawn of civilisation, and from their influence history with their own actions. Features that we plan to code in the future include, among others:</desc>
    <desc>- player parents (yes, you'll actually be able to get born as the child of other players. - custom-designed equipment - player-run clans and governements - immortal-run quests that will influence the future of the entire mud - custom skillsets: You'll be allowed to fully customize your characters abilities. - real time combat - many styles of magic, weapons, and martial arts</desc>

    <desc>Once upon a time, not so very long ago...  It was a perfectly ordinary world. Neither pure good nor true evil had a stronger hold, as most catered only to self-interests.  The masses toiled away supporting those at the top, all so they could go home at night, have a beer, and watch Survivor.  It was a world of muted pastels in which most people had exchanged passion for safety, wonder replaced by the certainty of routine, mundane existence.  The passing of time became remarkable only as old faces fell away to be replaced by new ones, part of the same cycle. All was perfect, an image reflected in a grayscape window. Then it shattered...</desc>
    <desc>A few strange cults around the world did something -- no one was quite certain what -- but hints of a forgotten, ancient past began to bubble up from beneath the surface of this static world. Half-remembered stories were once again whispered around campfires and on stormy nights.  Children again avoided the lonely old house at the end of the lane.  Sometimes secret wishes would come true, whether wonderful or terrible.  Nightmares and dreams alike began to stalk the hazy edges of mankind's consciousness.  None could explain what had happened, but something became clear to those who dared believe... The stories were true.</desc>

    <desc>Marvel Extreme v. 3.0 is open for business - come experience a comic book game unlike any that has come before! Dubbed \"the trade paperback lightning edition,\" MXT3.0's philosophy focuses on tossing out long +trait applications and introducing a miniseries writer's approach to playing a character. Conflict abounds on the IC grid, reflecting a recent cutoff just after the tragic end of the Civil War:</desc>
    <desc>--- Iron Man and his allies, in support of the Superhuman Registration Act, have come out victorious against Captain America and his Secret Avengers. All across the country, Iron Man's \"Initiative\" program is being implemented, and superheroes are being recruited into teams to protect each of the fifty states.</desc>
    <desc>Other heroes, still resistant to the registration process, remain active in protest of the Act and its principles, effectively becoming not just costumed vigilantes but enemies of the state, hunted both by criminals and SHIELD \"cape-killer\" squads alike. ---</desc>
    <desc>The game is open to OOC alt creation with a revolutionary coded IC character queue/tenure system. Plots are kicking off as we speak - heroes will be tested, villains will be feared, and the Marvel Universe will come to life more every day.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to the Shattered Realms.</desc>
    <desc>The owner of the \"Shattered Realms\" account has gone into hibernation, and the admins of the mud was forced to make a copy of the review until further notice.</desc>
    <desc>Our world began in June of 1999, and was under constant construction the first year. Opened for players quite soon after it was started, though there has been heavy construction all along. A fully interactional LP MUD, with many player interactive systems. The Mud systems are now mostly self designed. We have 9 races and some 25 classes.</desc>
    <desc>Roleplaying is encouraged, but not enforced. We have a consent based playerkilling system, where one actively has to register as playerkiller to be able to have fun. If one behaves badly or become high level, one just might be enforced to become a pk'er. Noone shall be too sure to not get in heavy troubble. Danger gives the game more nerve, however we have chosen to protect the young ones.</desc>
    <desc>Playing is based as many AD&amp;D medieval systems with xp hunting, though  supported by other systems. One is encouraged to go questing.</desc>
    <desc>Combat and magics are losely based on AD&amp;D 2nd edition ruleset, heavily modified into our own tweaks. Currently in progress of a workover towards AD&amp;D 3rd edition (D20) ruleset.</desc>
    <desc>We also have positions available for coders at all experience levels. From builder, programmer and writer all the way up to admin levels currently available. We prefer LP MUD experience and a strong desire to build your dreams for  others to enjoy them.</desc>

    <desc>The original MUD project has been discontinued as the development team has formed a game design company and are using Elvana as their first 3d PC game title.</desc>
    <desc>Elvana, a futuristic world wrapped in secrets Elvana, a futuristic world wrapped in secrets buried in time that were never ment to be revealed, a place you will never want to leave.  The world of Elvana is a speculative futuristic world where three races exist. The Elvani, Orci and Hu'Mas. Tolkien with a twist I suppose. It's a hard science concept though, with the Elvani having evolved and established a civilization in their ancestral grounds. A massive community on the continent that would one day become the mega city 'Motherholme'. The Elvani in what we would consider the technological period of the 1700's began exploring the rest of Elvana where they found the Orci whose society resembled that of our ancient Aztec culture. Having never encountered another sentient species before the Elvani discovered themselves to be highly xenophobic and soon returned with an armada which they used to enslave the Orci and deported them back to Motherholme. In this period of history one of the 7 Elvani dynasties rose to dominance and gave birth to an emperor who subjugated the other 6 dynasties and decreed the Orci slaves of the Empire. This reign lasted for over 600 years until an Orci called Char'Gunda escaped slavery and rallied an army that eventually overthrew the Emperor and his dynasty, setting the Elvani themselves free as well as his fellow Orci. His Elvani wife gave birth to the first Hu'Mas, a half-breed. 200 years later the game takes place in a world of futuristic technology where things like flying cars are common place (think Fifth Element to have a better picture). In this world the body is highly revered and controversial biological discoveries and genetic experiments are changing everything as this new field fast gains popularity.</desc>

    <desc>Heart of the Wyld is set in the present day, and based around&lt;br&gt; Yellowstone National Park and its environs. While both the park&lt;br&gt; and the area around it are at least loosely based off the real&lt;br&gt; world, there are some notable differences between it and HotW's&lt;br&gt; version of Yellowstone in the World of Darkness which can be&lt;br&gt; found on the MUSH's +news files.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</desc>
    <desc>The game focuses on the Garou, Werewolves. While other character&lt;br&gt; types do definitely exist often on the game, they are mostly&lt;br&gt; relegated to NPC-type characters for use in stories. This is to&lt;br&gt; allow the main characters to shine brightly, rather than be&lt;br&gt; muddled by so many different 'spheres' trying to co-exist in one&lt;br&gt; place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</desc>
    <desc>Character creation is by application. This is to make sure people&lt;br&gt; who are trying to play have enough of a grasp on proper&lt;br&gt; punctuation, grammar, basically all the things that allow a&lt;br&gt; player to interact with fellow roleplayers efficiently. In&lt;br&gt; addition, we want to make sure the character wanted fits well&lt;br&gt; with the current playerbase and the worldview of the MUSH. We&lt;br&gt; recommend you come on by the game and check out our +news files&lt;br&gt; on all relevant character generation information and&lt;br&gt; theme/setting. Our staff is always around and available for&lt;br&gt; answering your questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</desc>
    <desc>The theme of Werewolf: the Apocalypse is one of savage horror in&lt;br&gt; a world that is much like our own, yet twisted, with powerful&lt;br&gt; supernatural forces hidden behind the facade of modern life -- a&lt;br&gt; World of Darkness. Here at Heart of the Wyld, we focus strongly&lt;br&gt; on struggle. Internally, it is often the struggle between man and&lt;br&gt; wolf, between reason and the mindless fury of the Beast within&lt;br&gt; every Garou. Externally, this struggle manifests in such diverse&lt;br&gt; forms as inter (and intra) tribal conflict, and against any of a&lt;br&gt; myriad of external threats -- the Garou are at war, with the&lt;br&gt; Apocalypse looming on the horizon, and the inescapable fact is&lt;br&gt; that the Garou are losing. Some Garou lose hope -- their are&lt;br&gt; greater numbers of Ronin in the finals days than at any time in&lt;br&gt; history. Will that be your fate? Will you struggle in vain&lt;br&gt; against the nigh-overwhelming opposition that the Garou face in&lt;br&gt; their war? Or will you scoff at defeat, and go on to win&lt;br&gt; victories that are the stuff of legend?</desc>

    <desc>Ok guys this is my first actual mud to code on by myself as the owner. I coded for alot of other non dragonball games and did some building for quite some time. So the first thing i need is to hire some coders and builders. Now the coders have to have some EXP. I am not saying they have to be experts but if i am going to trust you not to crash my mud i want you to have a lil EXP. Another thing is builders. I will teach builders but i will not teach coders it is easier to teach a builder then a coder. If anyone is knowing they can perform one of the jobs you can email me at the admin email account which may take a while for me to reply to or you can email Vegeta at dracos_fang@yahoo.com my name is Goten and you can email my personal one at dakota44883@yahoo.com APPLICATIONS ONLY NO OTHER EMAILS TO ANY OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!! the application must include experience optional for builders the name you want and the password you want if ya dont want to give out a password let me know and i will set you up with one then send it back to you in a reply mail you must have an age on there an email address you want to be reached at by the administration and pretty much about it except for if ya have experience i am going to hire you quicker then ones with out and let us know the muds ya worked on and if they are down or still up internet email address will be posted on the mud unless you have strict rules not to do that but the administration needs it to let you know about updates and if we switch servers or not yall will be the first to know trust me but stop on in if you have time and one of the owners are on we will set you up with an interview and decide if we wanna hire ya see yall in there</desc>

    <www>http://ageofreptiles.weebly.com</www>
    <desc>Some years ago, when I was self-publishing hardcopied and electronically-published roleplaying games, I designed an rpg based on a comic book world of dinosaur life created by artist/writer, Ricardo Delgado. Now, using the Unknown Regions SWReality codebase, I bring to you the Age of Reptiles mud. Unlike any other mud currently available, AoR takes place in prehistoric times in a quasi-factual setting and enables players to portray Deinonychus characters. AoR is role-playing enforced and fully player-killing capable, in fact, the setting is outright deadly. Players may form packs to better enable their survival and, in time, might become a pack's alpha or perhaps an outcast from it. Characters can also mate and sire fully playable hatchlings. As a whole, the goal for all players is survival and character development through pack/mate interaction.</desc>
    <desc>Recent changes include the addition of three new areas and improvements to the mating system!</desc>

    <desc>The time for Highlands III is now.  In 2004/2005 a group of us got together and launched this project out of love and dedication and wanted to see the mud take its next step in hopefully becoming and even better mud. Some of the things we have added/brought back: 10 quest levels, Auto-Quests, Quest equipment, Battlefield is back, Clans are back, numerous commands, Automated auction system, New charmed system, Training system replaced the meta system, Made players stats more prominent in determining success rates of spells/skills, Lots of old zones have been revamped to make them more useful, Bunch of new zones. 	The current staff had discussion about what direction to take the mud in regards to our theme.  We had several options. First change the name: we have always been highlands so that wasn’t an option we liked.  Second to make it more like the movie/TV “Highlander”: we decided that wasn’t what we were after.  We decided to go with the idea of making it “Highlands of Scotland” the best way to go. 	A fully comprehensible plan and map was created for developing our theme and storyline, and is currently being built.  It contains over 70 zones nearly 400 rooms in roads all based in highlands from 1200-1600AD.  There is room for more to be added once the goals of this build has been achieved.  Each of these zones will contain mini-quests or quests.  After the first 16 zones are entered and functional the development of a playable storyline quest/reward system will be implemented. 	Highlands III welcomes new players, and embraces old players that have lost their way. We currently are seeing builders to help with the theme build project.  We have a fully functional OLC system, and combined with DG_scripts so builders can write there own spec_progs.  For first time builders we have a bit of an online manual/guidelines and lots of resources to help you with creating your very first zone.</desc>

Gero has another up, and Slug has the never-ending chat version of judymud up that he built from scratch, that can be found on here. All are playable versions, however they are each different.  This one in particular is more geared towards giving the players whatever they want that the mud is capable of, without turning it into a pointless game of ease -- instead, players are able to find easteregg-like items here and there, and when monitored by immortals, they may end up with a surprise custom item or too.  Basically it is purely to play without interference a more stable version of the particular distribution of judy/fred/henrymud, or to play while asking for help that will be limited, but often exactly what you would want, if it were your birthday. :)</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to Vorovski Mir. The year is 2039, the place is the fictional burgeoning metropolis of Vladivostok on the Eastern Seaboard of the former U.S.S.R.</desc>
    <desc>In the depths of the mountains guerrillas hide from Government troops, sneaking out at night to sabotage and attack, while the Government's underpaid, poorly-trained army fearfully patrols the day. Recently, UN peacekeepers have been called in, as pictures of violent reprisals against guerrilla-aligned student protesters circulated through the world media. Like sharks scenting blood, Private Military Companies have come in, some for the guerrillas, some for the government, some for the UN, some for other interests, followed by arms dealers, black marketeers, adventurers, drug dealers, bodyguards, thieves, hustlers, and traders of worse things.                                                              |</desc>
    <desc>Vladivostok has always been a city of energy, of progress, and the war has made little difference. Movie stars, fashion models, the rich and the beautiful, the noble, and the decadent are drawn here, the same scent of blood in the water that brings CNN and other news services brings a vast amount of the rest of the media with it. Organized crime thrives, preying off of the poor, the greedy, the desperate, and the gullible. The Russian mafia works from an uneasy truce with biker gangs and Asian mobs, while cash floods the \"Free\" City of Vladivostok, and even the police are not sure who all the criminals are or even what is a crime.</desc>

    <desc>Phoenix is a themed medieval/fantasy MUD.  We do not strictly enforce role-playing, but we do reward good RP and ask that player names, familiar names, travel messages, titles, profiles, etc. be appropriate for a medieval/fantasy environment.  Player reviews etc that are found inappropriate for this environment may be removed by the Powers.</desc>
    <desc>The object of the game is to explore the Land of Phoenix, kill monsters, solve puzzles (quests) and have a lot of fun.  As you adventure through the realm you will accrue both experience points and quest points.  Experience points are gained through sacrificing treasures to the gods by dropping items into the pits found at the Temple of Paradise, the Village Church and various other locations. Points are also gained for killing monsters.  Traditional playerkilling is not allowed except during tournaments or if both players have entered into the combat arena. We also make playerkilling available through a subclass system that allows players to become vampires, seraphs, or werewolves.  Quest points are gained by solving quests.</desc>
    <desc>You may play more than one character at a time as long as certain conditions are met, check the multiplaying information file for details.</desc>
    <desc>Once you have acquired the requisite amount of experience and quest points you are eligible to become a Novitiate Apprentice Wizard. At this time you can choose to become an immortal, or to reincarnate as mortal. If you choose immortality you may opt to reincarnate as a mortal at a later time.  In order to be eligible to take a wizquiz and move beyond the apprentice wizard levels, you must achieve Adept status (complete the game in all guilds and complete all quests at some point in any incarnation). Once you are a Paragon Apprentice Wizard, you may apply for a wizquiz with an ArchWizard or higher. This test examines both your knowledge of the Land of Phoenix and your familiarity with policy. Upon successful completion of your wizquiz you are promoted to the rank of Adept Wizard.</desc>
    <desc>If you can't find the answer to your question in any help or info file, feel free to ask an immortal or upper level player. Welcome to Phoenix, we're glad you're here.  Enjoy!</desc>

    <desc>1066 is considered one of those dates in Medieval England which is difficult to forget. At the start of 1066, England was ruled by Edward the Confessor. By the end of the year, a Norman - William the Conqueror - was king after defeating Edward's successor, Harold, at the Battle of Hastings. With three kings in one year, a legendary battle in October and a Norman in charge of England, it is little wonder that people rarely forget the year 1066. Many historians view 1066 as the start of Medieval England...And this is where our story starts. Come join the lands of change and the dark ages...

Since then, we have evolved and changed to become one of the most advanced SWR's out there. We don't have a huge playerbase, but because of that we can boast a more personalized experience, and be more community oriented. Due to problems with our last host, we have recently moved off our long time location at Wolfpaw to our brand new home on the blazing fast Infolaunch servers. Due to our move, we have had to playerwipe, and are currently offering a Christmas promotion, where newbies recieve a small boost at creation, which will allow them to better explore the game. If you're looking for a quality, friendly Star Wars themed MUD, Rebellion in the Stars is the place for you. Drop in and give us a try!  ----------------------------  The Clone Wars have drawn to an end, but the peace some sought at the end of that bloody affair is no where to be seen. The Jedi, once honored protecters of the Galaxy, have been outlawed and hunted down...  In the foreground, the Empire is a darkly dominating force. Those worlds that do not to bend to its will are forced to their knees by the might of the Imperial war machine. Corperations that can be of use to the Empire as seized and Imperialized, becoming just another cog in the wheel.  There is hope on the horizen, however dim. Freedom fighters, dubbed terrorist by the Empire, are taking their toll, hindering the Empires progress whenever possible. Scattered and small, they offer little resistance, however there has been talk of something more...  Join us at Rebellion in the Stars, and carve out your destiny!</desc>

This struggle for complete unity within the Known Universe has been difficult to achieve then originally perceived. As we stand here on the planet Urbanus, recently named by the Landsraad Head Council as the Universal Centre, we make countless attempts to communicate with those we have lost after the Jihad. Now here we loom, looking to the vast skies hoping our messages have been received and complied for it is here we will begin a new era of unified humanity. Here together, we will join the universe in peace. --- Voices of Dune has opened the doors to the public recently and the VoD staff wish to invite you to the MUSH. We are set roughly 10,000 years before the events of Frank Herbert's first Dune novel. The theme, taken from information within the Dune Encyclopedia, we feel it is a perfect setting for original and interesting events that would lead up to the Battle of Corrin, or miss it entirely due to RP. We offer a mixture of feature and custom factions to expand levels of gameplay. Original code is in the making to help move RP and 'rate' factions on their progress as the game moves forward ICly pending on actions and decisions a faction would make. This means a whole new econ and faction system none have ever witnessed! We regret to inform you that we are not open for IC interaction at this time as we are still in the process of building. However, we plan to have our doors open for IC interaction on February 16th! If you wish for further information, log onto Voices of Dune at duneiv.mushpark.com Port: 4244 and ask for Quetzalcoatl.</desc>

    <desc>A new incarnation of an old game that has been running since the 90's but was down for several years. Haven occurs in a future world where most of the planet has been infested by a shadowy enemy and the last holdout of civilization exists on Haven mesa beneath a magi-tech shield. Unfortunately, the betrayal of one of their trusted council members quickly led to the collapse of their original government and over time the people were reduced to a number of separate smaller villages with most of the residents seeing the shield and other ancient technology in a mystical or religious way. After a recent assault by the enemy, his Shadow, and the return of the original leader (or at least his animated corpse), people have begun to search for ancient technological and magical devices in the hopes of combining them to finally take back their planet. Race choices are virtually unlimited and many players may choose to import races from their favorite games or stories. Staff will attempt to fit any character into the theme. Everyone creates their own custom class, with anyone able to add new specials or items to the game (and an xp bonus if what you suggest is added). We wish this to be a mostly player built system and commands have been implemented which allow players to request additions without needing to code them The combat system is quite deadly, but ancient technology beneath the shield keeps death from being permanent. Adult and dark themed RP, as well as silly humorous role play, are both encouraged, with some scenes being both at the same time. This is a role play themed mud/muck, and thus thus character actions tend to have in character consequences. Being in the testing phase, we do not yet have a large population, but hope to continue growing as we advertise.</desc>

    <desc>NeoDBZ is a game that has been running for roughly six years, and gone through a myriad of changes in that time. Originally hosted on WebRPG, it moved to OpenRPG in 2000 and has stayed there since. Using a tabeltop style persistant world, there are strong similarities to a MUSH/MUX and player advancement is handled in almost exactly the same way. With a player base that has peaked near a hundred and been as low as a handful, this game ebbs and flows but never stops. If you want to make a character with personality and impact on a Dragonball style setting, this is where you want to be.</desc>

    <desc>It is common for a MUD to die - it is almost unheard of for a MUD to make a comeback, let alone TWO! But Midian: Funnest Mud of All is doing just that.</desc>
    <desc>Midian began in 1991, before surfin' the 'net was a phrase. In its first incarnation, it lasted until 1994, when its server went down. During that time it was highly original and well-respected.  For 8 years, it existed only as a memory on Yahoo groups - until as much of the original code could be brought back together. It was restored in 2001, died again in 2003, and is back yet again as of December 2005.</desc>
    <desc>Things that make Midian stand out:</desc>
    <desc>* It uses LPC code. LPMuds were very common in the early 1990s. Now MUDs have much more sophisticated underlying code. But what made Midian great were the crazy ideas.</desc>
    <desc>* The essence of fun. Midian is kooky and fun. One important social tradition of Midian is the Midian MUDwedding.  You haven't seen a real MUDwedding until you've been to one on Midian. Note: MUDweddings are not to be taken seriously, although the crossover to RL HAS happened on Midian!</desc>
    <desc>* But most importantly, it's the players and the ideas they bring to the MUD that make it so different.  We have been up again only for two weeks, and already have many of our old players and wizzes back -- Midian has incredible loyalty, despite being down for 10 of the past fifteen years!</desc>

    <desc>YorMUX is a very new MUX at this point in time, and is a staged, phase-driven MUX that starts off simple and grows in complexity as the players advance the storyline. Currently in Phase One, the players are left with the freedom to do almost anything within a very small space, with exploration and expansion of the grid as one of the main goals. Player-built structures and actions will evolve the MUX itself.</desc>
    <desc>The game uses an inbuilt Rating system to help keep adult activities from interfering with more general RP. It is a crossworlds MUX allowing both original creations and media characters(mostly from anime), with a confirmation process to categorize canonicity.</desc>
    <desc>Initial access to materials and equipment is limited, but can be expanded through the activities of the community as a group effort. Eventually the goal is to have a functional, player-run town or two with an organized attempt to explore more of the world, when the MUX will move on to Phase Two.</desc>
    <desc>This is a new and fairly experimental project for the admins, so there may be some adjustment and new code added frequently at first. The current incarnation is playable and open to new players, however.</desc>

    <desc>The name Babylon B.C. stems from my fascination withn ancient mythology, Sumeria and Babylon stuck out, with epic tales of great heroes (read: Gilgamesh) and gods/godesses.</desc>
    <desc>I decided what better way to share my hobby of godwars, and enjoyment of ancient mythology, than to make them both work together.</desc>
    <desc>The game itself will be loosely based on the Babylonian and Summerian tales, mythology, and stories. This is where Dystopia, Dystopia2 and Godwars in general come into play, as they have the base line classes that can work with those tales. Also allowing me to add more.</desc>
    <desc>My current projects are:</desc>
    <desc>**&amp;gt; Profession system: including mining, herbalism, blacksmithing, alchemy, tailoring and a couple of others.</desc>
    <desc>**&amp;gt; Copper, Gold and Silver currency system.</desc>
    <desc>**&amp;gt; Rewritten oldschool Godwars classes.</desc>
    <desc>**&amp;gt; Race additions: elves, gnomes, humans, orcs and the like.</desc>
    <desc>Many more to come...</desc>
    <desc>While the mud is currently playable, and fully functional while the changes are put into effect, I would ask that people who wish to test, locate bugs, build and or code send me an email, or leave me an ingame message on the personal board. Also all ideas and thoughts are welcome as well as suggestions, and criticism (constructive, or it will be ignored).</desc>

Transformers 2005 MUSH -- now set 16 years after the events of Transformers the Movie -- gives a whole new look to the Transformers universe. The Autobots struggle against the immense power of Galvatron, Cyclonus and the Sweeps with Earth and EDC caught in the crossfire.

    <desc>Since the beginning of time there has existed a base struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil.  Until now.  Long ago, the land was dominated by two major immortal forces, one, the champion of good (whose name has been lost in the ages), and the Devil, champion of evil. Within their immortal hordes were angels, demons and all other forms of magical beings.  Eternally they warred, never winning, never losing.  Little did they realize that their true power lied in their mortal followers.  Neither of the two paid any attention to the mortal plane..allowing it to fall to chaos.  This only increased the power of the Devil, for as the land became more chaotic in nature, the true evil of man's heart became known.  By the time the champion of good had noticed this, it was too late.  His power had dwindled too much and there was little left he could do. Evil had won out and the Devil ruled the realms, both immortal and mortal.</desc>
    <desc>What followed can only be termed as hell.  The Devil turned the world into a torturous experience for mankind, forcing the masses to work and slave their lives away.  Whisperings of rebellion were heard throughout the mortal realm.  Gradually these whisperings grew into a roar.  The people of the realm were not looking to fight for good, but to fight against evil. It was rumored that the Devil had lost his immortality during the great battle with his nemesis.  It was the truth of this rumor that a group of powerful wizards were staking their lives on.  These wizards had been born and raised in magical seclusion.  No one knows their exact origins, only that they existed.  This group of wizards, known simply as the Seven, fought their way into the Devil's immense castle and there engaged a magnificent battle.  They gathered their collective energy and cast a suicide spell on the Devil, sending him and six of their members into oblivion.</desc>
    <desc>This magical cataclysm tore the world asunder, shattering any concept of time or space.  Everything was shifted and torn from their rightful places. The world left from this is a nexus, combining places and people from times and worlds beyond.  Into this realm stepped the only one of the ancient Seven to survive the grand battle with the Devil, Lady Alecca.  She vowed to try and restore what order they could in this new realm. She assumed the role of the gods and forged into this world left by the Devil's Silence.</desc>

More than just multi-user programming environments, MUSEs foster a strong sense of community among participants.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome into the realms of Dragonball: The Hollow Chronicles. We run on a heavily modified DBNA 1.5 codebase.  We recently took bits and parts from all of the different codebases and packed them into this one, making things even better and even more modified than any of the other dbz codebases out there.  We offer a wide race selection, and its going to get even bigger, as we are going to mix in Bleach races and abilities as well, making it more half DBZ and half Bleach.  Many exciting things are already added in, things that seperate us from other DBZ MUDs out there.  DBZ names and Bleach names are also allowed on creation, so no worries about getting deleted because you want your name to be Goten, Gotenks, and so on. We welcome everyone with open arms, and our staff is also very mature, and always willing to assist the mortals when they have questions.  The players are also the same way, if you need help finding a place to gain at, just ask, and everyone will be more than glad to help out.  The staff is also always adding in new things code wise, and area wise.  We have a strong building team, and a strong coding team, and we always take suggestions and ideas from the players, because it is the players who keep the MUD alive, not just us Immortals.  So feel free to check us out!  But most of all! Have fun!</desc>

    <desc>Within these confines you'll find those Worlds you would love to be a part of. This is a MUSH for the imaginative person and good roleplayer; someone whom enjoys reading books and roleplay will find this experience an adventure that changes on a daily basis. There are no limitations to the experience you can have within the game.</desc>
    <desc>This is not going to be the typical Roleplaying MUSH, solely focused on one World and time. We do love various Universes and would like to play them all, and in the same MUSH. More than that, to play them all and in different times. What worlds are we speaking of? At the moment, they would be three:</desc>
    <desc>* Tolkien’s Middle-Earth (“The Silmarillion”, “The Lord of the Rings” and related books). * M.Z. Bradley’s Avalon and Camelot (“The Mists of Avalon”). * Martin’s Westeros (“A Song of Ice and Fire”).</desc>
    <desc>We want to build a MUSH focused on high quality roleplay, book verse, and aimed at fleshing out the stories of those times a bit more, not changing them. Staying true to the books we love will be a major concern, and although members are not required to be experts, a certain respect and enthusiasm for the works of these authors should be common.</desc>
    <desc>For those who have read the books and wished there were more detail in the stories, and all those blanks filled with dialogue and feelings are welcome to join and bring it all to life. At the moment we search for good players (and coders and builders!), to build a genuine and splendid site. There is a lot of available Book Chars waiting for you to play them.</desc>

Though the Emperor was killed during the battle of Endor, rumor has it, a new leader is on the Imperial capital.  Can the Empire continue to hold off the rebel fleet or, will the New Republic once again become the galactic power of the galaxy, or would a new threat emerge that would overwhelm both superpowers...</desc>

    <desc>He who has seen everything, I will make known to the lands. I will teach about him who experienced all things, ... alike, Anu granted him the totality of knowledge of all. He saw the Secret, discovered the Hidden, he brought information of the Time before the Flood. He went on a distant journey, pushing himself to exhaustion, but then was brought to peace. He carved on a stone stela all of his toils, and built the wall of Uruk-Haven, the wall of the sacred Eanna Temple, the holy sanctuary. Look at its wall which gleams like copper in the sun, inspect its inner wall, the likes of which no one can equal! Take hold of the threshold stone--it dates from ancient times! Go close to the Eanna Temple, the residence of Ishtar, such as no later king or man ever equaled! Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around, examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly. Is not the essence of the brick structure made of kiln-fired brick, and did not the Seven Sages themselves lay out its plans? One league city, one league palm gardens, one league lowlands, the plaza of the Ishtar Temple, three leagues and the Bazaar of Uruk it (the wall) encloses. Find the copper tablet box, open the ... of its lock of bronze, undo the fastening of its secret opening. Take and read out from the lapis lazuli tablet how Gilgamesh went through every hardship.</desc>

    <desc>\"The Visitors are not our Friends! They've come to rape our Planet and kill us! They are not who they appear to be!\" was the Resistance call.</desc>
    <desc>In October of 2001, the Visitor Motherships arrived over the cities of Earth, 50 in all. They claimed to have arrived intending peace, but they lied. They came to take us prisioner and to rob the planet of the resources. By the end of Novemeber, they controlled the planet. Lucky for the Earth, a Resistance was able to form, and beat them with the Red Dust.</desc>
    <desc>After a full year, they came back, as the Dust wasn't completely effective, and now, can not be released again for enviornmental and Health reasons. The warmer regions are back under Visitor Control, all except LA, thanks to a deal brokered between the Visitors and Science Frontiers, who has taken over the LA Government. That was 6 months ago. Now the Resistance is in hiding, for the most part, looking for a way to cause the Visitors troubles.</desc>
    <desc>V: The Visitors Return is a MUSH that allows you to take on the role of a Great Resistance Fighter, or an Evil Reptillian Visitor. Feature Characters from the NBC Mini-Series and Television Series are available for you to play. Visit us at mushland.com 1817</desc>

    <desc>So, you want to know about Mass Chaos? Well, lets start here... What is Mass Chaos? Mass Chaos is the prodigal child of numerous snippets of Godwars, Mindcloud, and Dystopia code. It's a PK MUD, and I'll go ahead and say it right now: It's NOT for pansies. If you're gonna log on and ask \"What's PK?\", just do me a favor and ingest some Drano now. This is kill or be killed, and the sooner that is realized, the sooner you'll be climbing to the top. Yes, you'll probably die a few times getting started, but contrary to popular belief, the players here will be more than happy to help you... (But only so they can kill you later).</desc>
    <desc>Here's the bottom line. If you're competitive, enjoy killing people, enjoy frequent changes, and appreciate staff members that listen to suggestions, you need to play this MUD... Plain and simple... If you whine or you're an effeminate hippie, you can play anyway, but you probably won't get very far. Why are you still reading this? Log on already.</desc>

    <desc>Inspired by the hit TV series that stirred the hero inside of millions of viewers around the world comes a roleplaying game that puts the future in your hands.</desc>
    <desc>Heroes MUSH. Here, you'll see familiar faces like you've never seen them before and many new heroes -- and villains -- ready to take the forefront in the new era of evolution.</desc>
    <desc>It's a big world out there. Those with evolved abilities are scattered all over the globe amidst billions of ordinary everyday people -- and they too are just everyday people, but perhaps not so ordinary. Regeneration. Time travel. Telekinesis. All of these unusual powers exist. There are those who would exploit these evolved humans: for control, money, power, scientific exploration or for the safety of the rest of the population... but most of the world doesn't realize these extraordinary people exist. Some of these unique humans want to save the world. Some want to end it. Some just want to make sure the bills get paid on time. They're just average people who have discovered they aren't so average.</desc>
    <desc>After some people experienced life as a fugitive last volume, now, in Volume Five, we explore something a little simpler: humanity. What makes us human? Does having an ability make you more than human? Where do you belong -- where is your family? We'll face these questions, with some challenges along the way. We'll also meet the Sullivan Brothers Carnival, a travelling carnival full of people with abilities, living under the radar as colourful carnies, with their own sense of family and a lot of mysteries of their own. And as always ... prepare for some surprises as you join Heroes MUSH in Volume Five: \"Humanity\".</desc>

Nazroth's hatred and malice sired a new realm of shadows, chaos, and destruction. War was unleashed and Torial broke apart under the violent stress as Good and Evil fought…</desc>
    <desc>And now we live in a New World, or perhaps I should say... Worlds..</desc>
    <desc>Forgotten Dimensions is a highly modified ROM/ROT combination MUD. Feel free and log on and totally forget about life in our quiet atmosphere. Create a character that will help you get lost in a world of Fantasy where Dragons fly through the skies and Magic is so very real. Humans aren't the only sentient beings and Nature is still a precious thing that will defend itself if it has to.</desc>
    <desc>Stand on the side of good, evil or neutrality. Join in the role- play of a world where just about anything is possible and where the Immortals aren't just rumors. Immortals who don't base their rulership on fear and destruction. (Not unless it's rp anyway.) Become an adventurer and one day perhaps even a hero.</desc>
    <desc>Although small, the playerbase is very loyal and rather interested in roleplaying and player killing. The mud has normal questing, area quests and arena. Runs are under construction. Further more the mud is still searching for people who are interested in building. The world needs to grow some more so the planets can be filled and the nexus opened so travel to other worlds can finally be launched. The mud has two tiers of 101 levels, 9 unique first tier classes and 18 unique second tier classes. There are 22 different races and 4 clans have been opened with several more on the way. For new players there is a newbie area to start in and additional support is given by the mud's fansite (www.stom66.com/fd) created by a few loyal players as repayment for the good times they had.</desc>

    <desc>MTBS Nations at War (NAW) starts out simple enough, but is deceivingly addictive. Played in real-time, players (mayors) build a city that will stand the tests of time by climbing to the top ranks of the game.</desc>
    <desc>The only way to do this is to research new technologies, build armies and structures, and ultimately attack and defend against other players. The game also features allegiances, resource sharing, live chat, and a private messaging system during game play.</desc>
    <desc>All you need to join NAW is either a Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer browser, and no additional plug-ins or software is required.  Add to the fun and encourage your friends to play! It's all free.</desc>
    <desc>NOTE: This website can't link directly to the game.  Go to mtbs3D.com's main site, and select \"MTBS Nations at War\" to play.</desc>

    <desc>Welcome to The Rebirth of Static Chaos. Static Chaos was derived from Chaosium, a great MUD started by a man known as Alathon 5 years ago.Over that time, it has gone from full Merc to about 95% original coding to emulate Godwars.</desc>
    <desc>&lt;u&gt;We're in the beta stage, so we are currently maxxing&lt;/U&gt; &lt;u&gt;anyone's first character on the MUD, and setting their&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;2nd character halfway there, so it doesn't hurt to give&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;us a shot.  We love getting new faces.&lt;/u&gt;</desc>
    <desc>We offer 5 classes, and are currently working on 2.</desc>
    <desc>&lt;u&gt;Saiyans&lt;/u&gt; - Dragonball Z &lt;u&gt;Patryns&lt;/u&gt; - Deathgate Novels &lt;u&gt;Fists&lt;/u&gt; - Fists of The North Star &lt;u&gt;Sorcerers&lt;/u&gt; - Slayers &lt;u&gt;Mazoku&lt;/u&gt; - Slayers &lt;u&gt;Paladins&lt;/u&gt; (Construction) - Diablo II &lt;u&gt;Patriots&lt;/u&gt; (Construction) - Metal Gear Solid partially.</desc>
    <desc>We offer a pretty intense PK environment.  Players love to battle eachother to the death in group fights, clan wars, 1on1s, and tournaments, where you can win nice prizes. It gets pretty competitive in here, so make sure you're up for intense PK.</desc>
    <desc>The fights are pretty balanced at the moment, but we're always working on making them more balanced and skill oriented.</desc>
    <desc>We've also got Gundams coded from scratch. Build up your skills from Leo to Epyon and show everyone what a machine can do when you attack them unexpectedly.</desc>
    <desc>&lt;u&gt;Free Suit Stats are given in Beta.&lt;/u&gt;</desc>
    <desc>Our current projects are....</desc>
    <desc>Challenge, Challenge watch, Challenge bet (90% in) Runes/Socketed Armor - (Diablo II) Arcade/Casino betting/playing Getting a Web Page up with Strategies and Newbie guides</desc>
    <desc>Our MUD is quite unique, and I think if you give it a shot, you'll see what we have to offer that all the other MUD's don't.</desc>

    <desc>In most scenarios, each player character is in fact a mutant, commie and/or secret society member, and is given a hidden agenda separate from the group's goals, often involving swindling or killing teammates. Hence the name, Paranoia. Therefore, Troubleshooter missions invariably turn into a constant comedy of errors as everyone on the team seeks to double-cross the others while keeping their own secrets. The game encourages an air of suspicion between the players, offering several tips on how to make Paranoia as paranoid an experience as possible. If the lasers come out before the players are out of the briefing room, the game is on the right track.</desc>
    <desc>Since every character comes in a six-pack of clones, death is less of an issue than in most RPGs, allowing Troubleshooters to be routinely killed (either deliberately or accidentally); instead of leaving the game, the player simply portrays the next member of the clone family, who is assigned to continue the mission. This easy spending of lives tends to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and frequent horrible and humorous demise. The term 'six-pack' is intentional, and is allegedly part of game design, where each player is given a six-pack of beer to represent his remaining clones.</desc>

    <desc>All new players start out on the web on a server not much different to that of the original Lyoko and are given full ability to roam and explore adjacent areas and servers. An extensive combat system is also included now in the form of a highly modified d20 system as well as some added bonuses. All players are given ample chance to build their players stats in the initial Character Generation.</desc>
    <desc>Players are mostly separated by class known as 'factions' and these are both thoroughlly covered in both combat and roleplay. The three active factions are 'XANA' (obvious), 'Guardians' (the original Lyoko Gang and followers), and 'Unaffiliated' (those who desire not to follow any one person).</desc>
    <desc>Roleplaying is still fully encourage and active plots still linger over players every day with more being brainstormed behind the scenes constantly.</desc>

    <desc>MutantMUSH is home to those who possess supernatural powers of various types. There are some who are able to walk through walls, can teleport, can create and control the very elements themselves. The appearance of these new subspecies has come into the public awareness very recently, but is unknown just how long they have been around. The public opinion varies from acceptance to down right hate.</desc>
    <desc>Anti-Mutant protest and hate groups have started to surface and have started to become more evident throughout the country. With the growth of these powers, law enforcement is at a loss for a way to control the threats that they bring. It is a constant battle to keep up with the growing threat that constantly seems to grow with each passing day. The constant struggle to keep law and order in the city. Protests, rallies and hate crimes have started to appear throughout the city as more and more mutants are revealed. The law enforcement has been forced to create the Mutant Task Force (MTF) in hopes to battle these recent string of Mutant related incidents.</desc>
    <desc>The lines have been drawn and the tension is starting to build. The world is changing and there are those who embrace the new stage in evolution while others fear and hate it. The government has yet to take a position on the new mutants. Mutants must now decide if they are going to use their new found powers to help mankind or for personal gain.</desc>

    <desc>Fast forward one thousand years past the time of the Silver Millennium. The souls of those who had died in the final attack on the Moon Kingdom have been sent into the future to be reincarnated - well, the future as in now. Present day. Tokyo, Japan. Queen Serenity had saved them all, but none remember anything about who they were, or anything about the Moon Kingdom and the Silver Millennium. If, however, evil forces should try to repeat what happened on the Moon, Queen Serenity ensured that Luna and Artemis (cats, and Royal Advisors of the Moon Kingdom) would be prepared - everything they would need for future earth was sent along with them. When the time came they would know what to do.</desc>
    <desc>Cue present day. Princess Serenity has been reborn as Serena Tsukino, and the other guardians (Sailor Scouts and Guardian Knights) along with Prince Endymion (Darien) have been reborn as well. None recall their past lives, and all seem to be pretty normal, typical teenagers living their lives and doing things they love. Unfortunately, their happy lives are about to be shattered. ======================================================================</desc>

Hiding amongst the Drow peoples, they entered into an ancient mausoleum. Within, there was but a solitary, stone grave. Opening the lone plot, it gave way to reveal a corpse, mummified in such a state the men were astounded that what was within still appeared living. The corpse, decorated in glittering jewels, was what they had came for. One of the men immediately reached for a ruby ring, still upon the hand of its now dead owner. The hand moved.</desc>

    <desc>AIVAS was a fantastic discovery.</desc>
    <desc>Among other things, the wonderful machine gave us the secrets to our earliest beginnings. It gave us plans and designs for technology that seemed something out of our wildest dreams. From it we learned how to make lenses for seeing the very small or the far away. We learned how to turn trees into paper and bind them into books with more ease than hide. But most importantly, we learned how to get rid of Thread.</desc>
    <desc>Or so we thought.</desc>
    <desc>The plan was so simple that it was beautiful. Use the dragons to get the engines from the floating ships and set them in strategic locations on the surface of the Red Star. Ignite them in sequence and push the asteroid out of its orbit. Floating through empty space, we didn't think the Star could have changed that much.</desc>
    <desc>That was the first of our fatal errors.</desc>
    <desc>When we ignited the engines, they didn't fire in sequence as planned. They all fired together. Our second mistake was the positions we placed them. How were we to know that impacts from other celestial bodies over the years had weakened the internal structure? How could we have guessed that our attempt to push the Red Star away would break it in half and double our worries?</desc>
    <desc>The resulting chaos plunged our world into disorder. Two comets with alternating orbits meant that we were now facing Passes of an estimated 200 turns, with only 50 year Intervals in between. For the first time in our history, we found ourselves with the very. very real threat of planetwide civil war.</desc>
    <desc>Nerat is the only Hold in the Northern Continent openly supportive of the Progessive philosophy; who say to use what we've been given and continue to grow from the information AIVAS provides. All others are either carefully neutral or openly for destroying the computer and sticking to the traditions that have carried us this far.</desc>
    <desc>Traditionalists versus Progressives.</desc>
    <desc>There's been enough of an outcry that the Weyr Council - in an effort to keep the peace and act as protection for the Crafters still in the AIVAS complex - sped up its plans to settle a Weyr in the mountains south of the complex.</desc>
    <desc>Two queens close to rising have come forth to lead this exodus, but not all see this project as a positive step. Many are against it and so the party they lead into the untamed south is small. They must work against the marked candles to bring their Eastern Weyr up to fighting fit before Southern withdraws its coverage.</desc>
    <desc>We don't know much about our future, but one thing is for certain.</desc>
    <desc>Life on Pern will never be the same.</desc>

    <desc>This is a remake of the original Rune MUD that was closed down almost two years ago. We have now reopened under new management from former immortals of the origninal version, Fewa and Scape.</desc>
    <desc>We are a RPG based MUD. Area's, race and class selection are mainly based off of other famous RPG's for various systems, ranging from all sorts of sources from Final Fantasy and Wildarms to Langrisser and Bahamut Lagoon. We are currently offering a newbie friendly MUD with lands that you may recognize from various games that you may of played. We also offer creation of various pieces of equipment by collecting items dropped from monster. Though you can still buy and find equipment in traditional style MUD. One thing that sets us apart from other RPG MUD's, is our materia system, or a version similar to that of Final Fantasy 7. You can find materia all over the world and embed them into one of three slots which gives you access to spells that are contained within it. After battles you gain AP which is used to increase the level of your equipped materia and allows you to gain access to even more destructive spells.</desc>
    <desc>I hope that you would enjoy your stay. Feel free to ask our staff any questions or concerns. We are currently still building our world and are looking for new builders to help increase the size of our MUD.</desc>

    <desc>We are a WoD game based in Dark Ages Prague. Currently accepting all Vampire Clans, and most Bloodlines, Garou Tribes, and most other Shifters, Mortal and Ghoul characters.</desc>
    <desc>The time setting is 1225, when the conflict between Lord Jurgen and Rustovich is at its peak, with handfulls of Tzimisce, Ventrue and Toreador falling every night. The other Clans cannot help but turn their attention to the fighting, and Prague, recently having two Princes up and disappear, is feeling the tension strongly.</desc>
    <desc>We're RP Enforced, so if you're looking for a hack and slash mud,you're better off if you keep looking. However, if you're looking for a creative evironment where you can build a complex character and get involved in countless storylines, you should take a look. Even if you don't know the first thing about White Wolf, we are newbie friendly, with the staff and the player offering advice or help to anyone with any questions.</desc>
    <desc>A background does need to be sent in, and accepted before a character is classed and may RP, but we work hard to make the process as quick and effective as possible, so you won't wait weeks, or ever days to be classed, or hear about the status of your character or application.</desc>
    <desc>Most of all, we are an open, and normally friendly group of staff and players, and we look forward to playing with new and interesting players and characters.</desc>

    <desc>Since the beginning of time there has existed a base struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil.  Until now.  Long ago, the land was dominated by two major immortal forces, one, the champion of good (whose name has been lost in the ages), and the Devil, champion of evil. Within their immortal hordes were angels, demons and all other forms of magical beings.  Eternally they warred, never winning, never losing.  Little did they realize that their true power lied in their mortal followers.  Neither of the two paid any attention to the mortal plane..allowing it to fall to chaos.  This only increased the power of the Devil, for as the land became more chaotic in nature, the true evil of man's heart became known.  By the time the champion of good had noticed this, it was too late.  His power had dwindled too much and there was little left he could do. Evil had won out and the Devil ruled the realms, both immortal and mortal.</desc>
    <desc>What followed can only be termed as hell.  The Devil turned the world into a torturous experience for mankind, forcing the masses to work and slave their lives away.  Whisperings of rebellion were heard throughout the mortal realm.  Gradually these whisperings grew into a roar.  The people of the realm were not looking to fight for good, but to fight against evil. It was rumored that the Devil had lost his immortality during the great battle with his nemesis.  It was the truth of this rumor that a group of powerful wizards were staking their lives on.  These wizards had been born and raised in magical seclusion.  No one knows their exact origins, only that they existed.  This group of wizards, known simply as the Seven, fought their way into the Devil's immense castle and there engaged a magnificent battle.  They gathered their collective energy and cast a suicide spell on the Devil, sending him and six of their members into oblivion.</desc>
    <desc>This magical cataclysm tore the world asunder, shattering any concept of time or space.  Everything was shifted and torn from their rightful places. The world left from this is a nexus, combining places and people from times and worlds beyond.  Into this realm stepped the only one of the ancient Seven to survive the grand battle with the Devil, Lady Alecca.  She vowed to try and restore what order they could in this new realm. She assumed the role of the gods and forged into this world left by the Devil's Silence.</desc>

The power of the Gods has waned over the centuries,giving the realm over to the trials and triumphs of the mortals and their impermanent desires. The Imperial City of Danewyr, left to the governance of the Old Nobles after the triumphant rebellion of the Alliance, has crumbled from infighting and sedition; however,the Trade City of Urda thrives as a central metropolis of cultural diversity, religious freedom, racial understanding. The small academy village of Travers, where many of the realmâ€™s adventurers have learned the arts of combat,healing,and runes,bustles with the activities of the young and old perfecting their chosen professions. Denizens of Aedin adventure and seek to rebuild the lands ravaged by war and tyrannical rulers, yet whispers of the evil long since past sifts through the winds,caressing the lips of those who would speak its name.</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars: New Horizons takes place 5 years after the fall of the Empire at the Battle of Endor. SW:NH is a MUSH where the emphasis is on Role-Play, not Roll-Play. While we do plan to have a detailed CharGen process, this is only to help facilitate the player-base in their search for engaging and entertaining Role-Play. We are running the latest version of the PennMUSH server with no hard code modifications. What this means for the players, is that we will be able to keep the server up to date without having to worry about system getting broken. While the overall focus of the game in public areas is PG13 rated, we do expect that players will wish to play out scenes that are of a more adult oriented focus and provide the player with a small quota to create objects they can drop on the game grid so they may be out of site for these scenes. A space system is in the works so that players can own ships and have grand space battles just like in the movies.</desc>
    <desc>Currently the game is under development and not open to the general public. We are however hiring coders and builders to help speed along the development of the game so we can open as soon as possible. If you are interested in applying for a position as a coder or builder, please feel free to email a resume of your coding/building experience to jaren@newhorizonsmush.net.</desc>

    <desc>We differ from some adult MU*s in that we have a full character sheet, are a little more limited in scope, and tinysex isn't as in your face in public. We are like other adult MU*s in that we want to provide players with a safe, sane and consensual environment to explore fun and fantasies. Of course since we are an adult game, all players should be at least 18 years old.</desc>
    <desc>Rather than divide our players into the usual horror races (such as vampires, shapeshifters, faeries, magic users) we have two races: Humans and Oddkin -- a subrace of humans with special powers as varied as the imagination of the players behind them.

    <desc>Four million and three thousand years ago, the war on Cybertron continues to go strong, despite the levels of available energon sinking further and further each cycle. Much of the planets' former architecture and lands has been destroyed, with only a few small oasis left here and there, hidden away on the surface or deeper inside Cybertrons' inner layers.</desc>
    <desc>From the towering pinnacle of Polyhex, the Decepticons dominate the skies with their air superiority, led by the ruthless Megatron. Inside the halls of their Flight Academy, seekers emerge as trained warriors, ready to serve for the glory of the Empire.</desc>
    <desc>Hidden under the dome of Iacon, the heroic Autobots have been driven practically underground, where their landbound forms gave them an edge in the constricted underlayers. Led by the powerful, honorable Optimus Prime, they accept all comers into their own training facility hidden inside Cybertron's second layer, and struggle to keep themselves, and the refugees from the war protected and functioning. A daunting task, indeed, and some may say a futile task.</desc>
    <desc>And finally, there is Crystal City. The last beacon of the golden age of Cybertron on the surface, its' walls shimmer still with the power of Energon, though not as brightly as it did back then when all of its' collectors were opened fully to the sky. Even it felt the strain of resources from constant attacks by the Decepticons. Closing its' gates to immigrants, it claims full neutrality, remaining a trading hub for citizens of any faction, and guarded by the last of the ancient Guardians - Omega Supreme, and his brothers - and the elite Crys Guard, champion-monks of the Temple of Primus. Led by the honorable, if manipulative Solarix, it intends to hold out to the bitter last, and even Megatron knew that razing the city would destroy the largest energon source left on the planet.</desc>
    <desc>Energy resources on the planet change hands frequently, and each faction has a distinct military and citizenry to it. Join the Transformers as not seen before in three million and one thousand years! Plots will range from planet-scale, to Spotlight focus, with a custom made, OPTIONAL combat and advancement system.</desc>
    <desc>Dark Age of Cybertron is very close to opening for applications, with hopes of having an official 'opening tinyplot' of epic scale in early january after the holidays!</desc>
    <desc>For now, we seek out staffers - plotstaff for long term, and descers for the grid. Knowledge of Cybertron and Transformers is essential.</desc>

    <host>wakemud.com</host>
    <port>2177</port>
    <www>http://wakemud.com</www>
    <desc>Built on a ROM codebase, many modifications have been made to enhance gameplay, creating a fun, customizable interaction that promotes ease of use, skill, and technique. Among its features are attackspeed based combat, skill trees, class changing, and many gameplay tweaks.</desc>
    <desc>Rather than traditional rounds in which everyone hits at the same time, each player attacks individually based on their own speed. This allows for increased customization and use of strategy, but only in that skills can be timed to coincide with attacks, regular players can continue to use skills as they did on stock ROM without hindrance. Spells are based on a cast time, rather than post-cast lag, giving them a more realistic feel, and creating gameplay elements related to antimages and fighters. At certain levels, players change classes, starting as a Tenderfoot, they refine their training through a class tree that results in a final, specific class. For instance, a player could go from tenderfoot, to fighter, to rogue, to assassin, or from tenderfoot, to mystic, to mage, to wizard. There are eighteen planned final classes, and further customization within each. Classes use a skill tree which is tailored to the player's class. Players receive skill points at each level which can be used how the player wants. Skill points can be used to increase each skill up to level five, which increases the power of effectiveness of the skill. This allows players the option to either spread the points out and gain every skill at an average level, or specialize in a certain field. There have also been numerous smaller changes to enhance the gameplay experience, including groups saving through quits and copyovers, and many unique skills and skill functionality.</desc>

    <desc>Vikings is a browser-based game which mixes elements of a text MUD with elements of a web-app style Sim. Vikings is a game of adventure, trade and warfare set in our own mythological version of the ancient lands of Thule. Our Thule belongs as much in the realm of fantasy as history, mixing old norse culture with modern fantasy themes.</desc>
    <desc>You'll begin as the head of a family of settlers. Through both good management of your domain and successful adventuring you'll grow into a powerful viking hersir! You'll choose to settle in one of 21 different regions with varying attributes such as medicine women, slavers, or alewives. You'll raise cattle, shear sheep, plow farms, improve your fortress, build longships, mine, and expand your meadhall to entertain more húskarls for your conquests. You'll need sturdy spears from your smithies and a plentiful supply of strong drink to build a loyal army bent on winning tribute from other players and clans. Your people will make demands and multiply as you meet them by trading with good neighbors and players in other regions. Discover which goods your region can export profitably, set your prices, and compete for the financial dominance that will fuel your expansion.</desc>
    <desc>While waiting for your population to regenerate you can venture forth into the wilds of Skåne in search of raw materials for your domain or personal glory for your viking hersir. Vikings uses AJAX and javascript to take advantage of your web browser's ability to provide a mouse-friendly interface with helpful tool tips. Kill, skin, and butcher your prey without typing a single letter, then move on by clicking the minimap which keeps you from getting lost. We also maintain the good points of a MUD, which means letting your imagination do the work rather than forcing you to envision your world as a cartoon. You'll see updating text descriptions of your environment at all times without ever typing look.</desc>
    <desc>Roleplay is highly encouraged and PvP is a necessary evil in this harsh world at war. New features are being added every few days. We're just getting started, but growing quickly. Carve out your kingdom now!</desc>

    <desc>Berlin continues to shrug off the effects of the second world war and collapse of the wall in the 1990s. There are many areas of the city that are still in ruins and many buildings and roads are still shambles as the poor beg on the streets. While many monuments still stand with German pride, many people find it hard to cling to their nationalism as the Turks and other new residents take advantage of the poverty that continues. Then there was construction. With the beginning of renovating most areas of the city came jobs and many, yet not all, Berliners are finding employment and a small place to live. The feeling of pride came back to many hearts even though many have no idea where the money came from to fund such progress. While there are still drugs on the streets and violence at night, hope slowly begins to rise in the hearts of many in the city. However the drugs and panic in the streets won't wash away all that easily. At night freaks roam the clubs and speak of crazy things like creatures of the night who wish to possess them. Of course that's just crazy and no one believes such a thing and the more such rumors circulate around, the more the city administrators seek to encourage the youth to stay away from drugs. So naturally the meister of the city has a lot on his hands but as progress continues the people seem more content than they were before. Tourism, trade, the GMBH, and an unknown source of funds keep the economy improving.</desc>

    <desc>Back in the eighties, in Japan lived a now very famous man. His name being Akira Toriyama. Toriyama San created some of the most beloved and well recognized characters between East and West. With the restart of the franchise in America, there developed a simple Smaug game, and that is Dragonball Saga. That was in 2000. Now, nine years later, the codebase branched off and created many clones. Some private, some public, all with their own little worlds. So, you ask, what does this have to do with this game? This I would say, is that despite the years, criticism, and power struggles, it lives on and The Revolt is here.</desc>
    <desc>The Revolt was created to bring forth the ideas of old and new, and to form a community of players who would love to play that game of yesteryear but with new skills, races, and a constant flow of ideas. The skill system, not seen very often in many clones, was developed by experienced coders and to this day is still being built upon by the people who were there since Day One. This skill tree allows for a free motion of techniques for when you begin. Adding much flavor to the game for veterans. The race system built upon Dragonball characters though relying heavily on the material of the show. It also strives to build your own unique concept of your character and with a bit of imagination, your own world. The races themselves range from the brutish and snide Saiyan, the maniacal and power hungry Icer, to the hellish pits of the Deadzone to bring the Demons and watchers of the universe, the kind-hearted and enigmatic Kaios. As for the community, we strive to bring an entertaining and no nonsense attitude, but listening all the while.</desc>

Meat MUD Classic was inspired by the original Meat MUD started at the University of Texas in 1993 - originally a modified Merc MUD with a Dungeons &amp; Dragons theme blended with some outlandish humor.  Please don't mind Frank Zappa - he's always been the mascot of Meat MUD.</desc>
    <desc>Meat MUD Classic uses a modified Greed source with mostly stock areas. OLC is waiting for willing builders who want to get creative and add to the world. Greed was based on Envy 2.2 and features most add-ons expected in modern MUDs today, in addition to OLC.  We feature extra classes, multi-classing, races and interactive NPCs. We're just getting started, and there is much to do, but if you want fun, we have it.</desc>
    <desc>We are purposely retaining a mostly stock MUD to pay homage to the original Meat MUD, and also to make it easier for old-timers to be able to quickly join and play.  Why learn how to play a MUD all over again?  Why not just jump into Meat MUD Classic?</desc>
    <desc>That doesn't mean that Meat MUD Classic holds no surprises - there are new areas waiting to be explored, and some classic areas hold new challenges.  Jump right in to see what we mean.</desc>
    <desc>We all have our comfort games. Some of us prefer to know the ins and outs of the games we grew up on, and miss the comfort of a MUD that had become our home away from home. Meat MUD Classic strives to be such a home, and as such we intend to avoid making the game \"more realistic\" or sacrifice fun in favor of \"balance\".</desc>
    <desc>Former Meat MUD veterans are always welcome - and bring your friends!</desc>

    <desc>'Anime' speaks for itself.  It is the culmination of years upon years of steady evolution.   It is a place to re-experience, re-learn, and re-live the game you have loved since the mid-1990s.</desc>
    <desc>The mud has 8 races: Air, Earth, Chaos, Order, Fire, Water, Life, and Death.  All of them have the chance to evolve twice -- and once that is accomplished you are eligible to 'remort' your class.  So much variety.</desc>
    <desc>All of the favorite areas you remember from before still exist.  However, there has been an influx of over 20+ areas going into the mud.  Every single piece of equipment (including stock) has been completely redone --- nothing is irrelevant.</desc>
    <desc>There is a full set of quest equipment available, and for remorted classes....Legend Equipment. There is a 'character upgrade' list, meant for the very seasoned players looking for that edge. There is an adventure point system that awards players with variation beyond belief regarding intangibles of the mud.</desc>
    <desc>Although we are still under reconstruction, I have ran this MUD for over three years without one single playerwipe.  Rest assured, the races and classes are in a very healthy position to be considered 'complete'.</desc>
    <desc>Join in on the fun....with all of the changes that have occurred within the last couple of decades, the screen is still black and text colored in the world we live in.</desc>

Animals have taken over the planet, all of which are fighting over supremacy of individual states.  Most every animal on the planet earth has become more skilled in combat and strength due to the fact that they've been exposed to nuclear radiation for so long.  They have given away to their basic instinct which is to fight for survival of the fittest.</desc>
    <desc>We have 20 races to choose from, and each member can choose a class they wish to join as well.  Currently we have all stock rooms, with very little edited, as we are in the planning stages.

If that sounds like you, please log on and create a character, and once you've joined, speak to an immortal. If you type WHO, and look for those who have the &amp;lt;IMP&amp;gt; sign next to their name, just ask over ooc channel if they could come out and talk to you about either a builder or coder position.</desc>

    <desc>Way Of The Force is based on the ideas of the Star Wars universe with some elements from other scifi stories. This universe is filled with trillions of people of all kinds of races, ranging from humanoids to droids.</desc>
    <desc>The game uses a timeframe long after the Emperor has been killed.</desc>
    <desc>Since the days of Luke, Jedi have again become the defenders of the (new) Republic, and many of them are found in our galaxy.</desc>
    <desc>Years after the Emperor died, the empire is clinging on to life, but it has been in decay for centuries now. With the death of Sidious the old Sith order collapsed, but many dark-side force users have come in its place, many of which indentify with the legacy of the Sith.</desc>
    <desc>As a player of WOTF, you are one of the select group of people who has the ability to 'use the force', and your task is to become a well trained user of the force, either on the light side or on the dark side. Ultimately, you can become a master on the Jedi council, even become its leader, or when you fall for the dark side, you could become powerfull enough to rebuild the Sith order and become its master.</desc>
    <desc>------------------------------------------------------------------</desc>
    <desc>Way Of The Force is currently testing the combat system and the 'new player' experience. We are not officially open for playing but our current playtesting is public and you are invited to participate.</desc>
    <desc>Feedback on the mud by means of mud mail or idea/bug reports is very welcome.</desc>
    <desc>We are also looking for people who have experience with both the DGD driver and LPMud derived codebases, please contact Aidil or Kalten on the mud.</desc>

    <desc>Thousands of years after the defeat of Shuyin, the people of what once was Spira have rediscovered their past. Ancient texts of cities long past, technological and magical; methods of drawing power that have since been lost to the darkness of time and the disasters that have unfolded throughout the years--all have been rediscovered by the people. The original name of the planet has been restored. And the world of Gaia is in for change.</desc>
    <desc>But the world cannot support them all. All these methods of drawing power have a price. The world now draws its power from its past. Dubbed the 'Paradox Effect', this odd phenomenon occasionally draws more than power. Sometimes it brings people forward, from the past to the present. And sometimes it takes people into the past.</desc>

It's been a generation since the Jupiter Event occurred and the world is still learning to cope with the rising number of Meta-humans. It is a somewhat dark future where the concepts of Good and Evil have been eclipsed by Publicity and Entertainment. It is a world of heavy contrasts separated by shades of gray.  JC is a game where adult-style and mature role playing is allowed. If you are not comfortable with the possability of adult situations occurring while playing then you should choose a different game.  Players are encouraged to be as original with their characters as possible. Character application is quite easy, requiring only a few lines or a couple paragraphs. Character logins are usually returned withiin minutes of reading.  JC has recently re-opened to the public. Join in while the player base is growing and everyone is fresh with excitement!</desc>

If you're trying to come up with an explanation for why an aspect of the Naughty Village is the way it is, you're thinking too hard!</desc>
    <desc>Features certain coded systems for bondage-related phenomena, as well as Predicaments, which Doms (i.e. those who are Dominant in the BDSM scale) can use to do naughty things to their Subs (who are set Submissive). Also includes a Slave class, allowing further control. It's not mandatory, and you can set yourself Switch to ignore the BDSM aspects entirely! All genders welcome, whether male, female, or hermaphrodite, so ... welcome to NaughtyMuffin MUSH!</desc>
    <desc>We are currently in need of people whose preference is for males, gay or bisexual males, and female characters who are both not strictly dominant and whose preferences include males (other than girly ones). We're not going to actually turn you down if you're not, though!</desc>

    <desc>Our spell system is fun as well as each spell has several levels of power for the same spell with effects ranging from merely making the effects of the spell more powerful, to altering the result of the spell.</desc>
    <desc>We have guilds that focus on the use of pets, magic based guilds, combat guilds, hybrids, and guilds based around our player economy such as Merchants and Arcane-Imbuers. Nearly all gear worth owning is made by players in those last two guilds so they are always in demand.</desc>

    <desc>Requiem-mud seeks to immerse players with participation in plots imm and player run alike, starting off in the town of Grey.</desc>
    <desc>The town of Grey</desc>
    <desc>Grey has been standing for hundreds of years, it is said that originally it was founded by the city of Jhal as a outpost to watch over the borders of the Wyrm’s Wood but it eventually expanded into a trade town. Some rumours say that the true reason Grey was built was to sate the curiosity of some nobles of Jhal, regarding some ruins that had stood where its foundation was lain.</desc>
    <desc>When Jhal fell to unknown hosts the town was able to survive and prosper on its own, having become entirely self sufficient with a host of fertile farmlands and water supply.</desc>
    <desc>Grey is situated nearby the Long Road which leads past the mountains to the Capital of Khal. Grey sees many travelers each year, some stay only for a night or two, though others find themselves lingering in the bustling town if for their own reasons or not.</desc>
    <desc>Despite its popularity there is much danger to be had; the bards in the inns find themselves often strumming a tune to someone whose deeds would other wisely be forgotten.</desc>
    <desc>The Pale river runs through Khal and passes by Grey, the harbor of Grey a center point for commerce and foreign trade. The town itself often serves as a meeting place for traders or a haven for refugee's from other Kingdoms due to its policies.</desc>
    <desc>Grey not only draws the attention of travelers, adventure seekers and merchants, but members of the Ten Guilds is often sent to it to gain experience. Due to the influx and variation of people available within the town, the members are able to learn to deal with those of different culture.</desc>
    <desc>Most who come to Grey have their own reasons though, some of which are never known.</desc>

    <desc>Top of the Line like many (if not all muds) use experience points for the advancement of characters. Experience points are used to raise stats (strength, intelligence, willpower, constitution, dexterity, and charisma) which determine how powerful you are (stat wise). You gain experience points from killing monsters (or players) and solving quests (or puzzles).</desc>
    <desc>Our wizards pride themselves on actually listening to the input from mortals and designing the mud around suggestions and ideas from the whole community. We are currently and always looking for mortals &amp; wizards to join the ranks of TOTL.</desc>

    <desc>1000 NE was in many ways a turning point within the Westlands. The Borderlands having fallen to a concentrated campaign from the Shadow, its people driven from their homes in large numbers. The Seanchan, invaders from western lands across the Aryth Ocean, finally cemented their foothold in Arad Doman and Tarabon after years of dealing with rebellions. And, worst of all, the man who was thought to be the Dragon Reborn was proven to be a False Dragon, and an assembly of the rulers of these lands, the Amyrlin Seat and Hall of the White Tower included, turned into a bloodbath before finally he was stopped.</desc>
    <desc>New rulers have been selected, and the White Tower's new Hall has chosen a new Amyrlin Seat. The Borderlanders have gathered into a fledgling alliance based in lands to the north of Andor, on a reclaimed city they call Gamael. Cairhien, though still racked by a multi-sided civil war and bands of mad channelers, seems on the way to recovery with the establishment of a Black Tower. Though the Seanchan Empire has suffered a blow, the Empress having relocated to Tarabon's capital of Tanchico after Seandar was seized by rebels, it too is growing more powerful with Arad Doman and Tarabon having finally being admitted into the Empire as full provinces.</desc>
    <desc>But the threat posed by the Shadow cannot be forgotten, with the occasional raid being the least of the worries of the inhabitants of this land. In this time, heroes and heroines are needed for the Light's only hope rests in everyone doing their best to repel the many threats that face those opposed to the Dark Lord. Are you willing to do your part?</desc>

    <desc>** Shattered Isles is currently in ALPHA testing. **</desc>
    <desc>Shattered Isles is a medieval-themed fantasy world where vast oceans have separated Archai into five inhabited islands and a number of smaller ones in between. Four of the large islands represent each of the world's elements: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. Located centrally is the fifth and newest isle, New Archai--the melting pot of the world.</desc>
    <desc>In Shattered Isles there are 16 different races from which to choose: one of four different Elven races severed by The Great Shattering, Dragons, Dwarves, Goblins, Gargoyles, Humans, a giant canine race known as Vukasins, faerie-like Sylphs, a giant humanoid race known as the Argali with horns much like a ram, giant Gavial lizards, and the Bolinau, a race of bipedal river creatures; think Otter meets Hobbit.</desc>
    <desc>The player classes consist of Air-mages, Earth-mages, Fire-mages, Water-mages, Diviners, Arcanists, Thieves, Assassins, Hunters, Barbarians, Fighters, Templars, Clerics, and Shamans.  Players do not have an overall level to rank up. Instead each class consists of some ability levels that account for all the related skills that fall under each domain. For example, all of your weapon related skills advance an overall combat ability in addition to the actual weapon skill. Mages have a similar spellcasting ability that accounts for all of their learned spells. In Shattered Isles there is no level limit. Every skill and ability can be trained up to a hundred levels and every skill available to your class can be learned and mastered.</desc>
    <desc>The merchant system of Shattered Isles is a huge aspect of the world. All players regardless of class have the opportunity to learn most gathering skills and some basic crafting skills. Additional crafting skills are unlocked as you progress in your overall trade ability. Even more crafting skills are available to those who portray their character as a merchant and have paid proper fees to the New Archai Trading Guild. Player merchants may purchase shops for buying and selling goods and are entitled to custom orders throughout the year.</desc>
    <desc>Role play is strictly enforced by a dedicated and available staff, while conflict and fighting between players is always encouraged! What you won't find in Shattered Isles are flashing colors, annoying Out Of Character channels that take away from the environment, having to track down your dead and looted body, or a MUD straight out of the box with nothing unique to offer. In Shattered Isles we've spent more time than we would like to admit focusing on the smallest of details. We take pride in providing a world in which you can immerse yourself.</desc>

The Colonial Fleet scrambles to meet the attack while the government is obliterated. The Fleet meets a similar fate within a day during one-sided battles all across Colonial space. The genocide of the human race is almost complete. Almost.</desc>
    <desc>This is the story of the survivors that were either left behind or chose to stay behind and fight. It begins with the Colonial Escort Carrier 'Kharon' and its small crew of dedicated and proud sailors that intend to fight to the end. But it doesn't end there. What of those left on the planets? The small bands of survivors? Can they simply be abandoned to the Cylons and radiation?</desc>
    <desc>Players here won't find a fleet of ships being escorted around the stars by the savior military. They won't find a government being set-up to debate social issues - at least not in the beginning. There are more important things like staying alive. The players tell the story and unfold it in their own way with the backdrop being the desperation and darkness of fighting a battle that will likely surpass their own lives.</desc>

    <desc>Immortal Wars is an up and coming Godwars mud with a very attentive imm that does it all from coding completely original classes to adding unique features and even building areas.  The imm is a professional software developer with degrees from MIT in computer science so rest assured you will be playing a quality mud.</desc>
    <desc>Although there are many MMORPGs to play nowadays, most of the good ones have a subscription fee, tend to require good hardware, and most importantly are hard to play at work.  Immortal Wars will always be free to play and is the perfect game to play at work since it requires commodity hardware and you can always alt-tab when your boss comes walking by.</desc>
    <desc>This mud has no stock classes at the moment in favor of some brand new classes.  The current classes that we have are: Brawlers | Dragoons | Elementals | Holy Knights | Hydras | Mechwarriors | Rogues | Snipers | Summoners | Astartes | Enchanter | Awakened. To see specifics on each class, please visit the website at http://raiden.servegame.org</desc>
    <desc>This mud has completed its beta-testing phase as over a hundred accounts have already been opened.  The pbase varies depending on time of day but has had an average of 5-10 players in the past three weeks.</desc>
    <desc>All feedback is welcome. One of the best things about this mud is the player base.  There are a lot of creative players who help improve the mud in many different ways, from improvements to classes, kingdoms, generic look and feel, etc.  Our idea board is bursting at over 80 ideas in just the past 2 weeks.</desc>
    <desc>Ideas for new classes are welcome too!  The sniper class was actually proposed by a player and then later implemented by me.  Classes are modified as players get more ideas.</desc>

    <desc>- Fully automated RealSpace mission system, featuring both 		PVE- and PVP-style combat</desc>
    <desc>- Flexible team creation system, which allows players to c</desc>
    <desc>		reate their own units, hire and fire pilots, and negotiate 		 individualized contracts</desc>
    <desc>- Customizable 'Mechs and other combat units</desc>
    <desc>- Dynamic character advancement system and economy, in 		which players (individually) and units (collectively) progress along 		multiple dimensions</desc>
    <desc>- Substantially expanded skill usage, which opens 		multiple character generation options - want better mission payouts? Be 		prepared to negotiate; salvage an enemy unit and want to use it 		yourself? Better find someone who can decrypt the pass-codes; want to 		customize your 'Mech? Make sure your squad includes someone who can 		tinker with the parts</desc>
    <desc>- Active story-arcs, in which player actions determine 		the outcomes and impact the game's evolving timeline</desc>

    <desc>Dragonball: Fate is a hybrid mud.  It has the deep roleplaying aspect of a MUSH, but the functionality, and good looks of a MUD.</desc>
    <desc>We run a D10 Based system, completely built around roleplay, there is no killing mobs here, in fact they don't even exist. You pose(emote) out your actions, and Immortal Storytellers assist by making appropriate rolls to ensure parity.</desc>
    <desc>Characters are extremely unique on the mud.  Between character backgrounds, merits, flaws, and Random Variables (Rolled at character creation), the mud creates very personable characters.</desc>
    <desc>A character must create a background for their character to be allowed play, this needn't be extensive, but should give us an idea of why a character is who he is.</desc>
    <desc>Bottom line is, if you love dragonball, and want a friendly, and heavy RP environment, come on down :).</desc>

    <desc>\"You believe your world is the center of existance, that your world is the most important place in the universe. That all the cosmos revolves around you and your almighty civilization, and the gods fawn upon you. Let me be the first, then, to shatter your illusions of grandeur.\"</desc>
    <desc>\"Your world, your kingdom, your ruler; All are insignifigant motes of dust in the wind. Outside your narrow point of view is everything, infinity in all its glory and majesty. The cosmos is infinite in its themes and variations, with space for everything gods or mortals could ever dream of and more. If you have dreamt fondly of it, it is waiting for you out there. If you have seen it only in your worst nightmares, it lurks out there. Infinity is a very large place, and the unwary will disappear between its cracks, unnoticed and unmourned.\"</desc>
    <desc>\"Your right to rule means nothing to us. The only power that matters out here on the Planes, little man, is belief. The planes run on belief, and it matters little what you believe in, only that you believe in it. Even the gods know this, and fight their eternal wars of belief on these puny worlds you call home.\"</desc>

    <desc>Planar Pathways is a MUSH that incorporates the past 30 some years of Dungeons and Dragons material and campaign settings into one place. The focus of the MUSH theme is Planescape, providing a means to get to almost anywhere in the D&amp;D multiverse. Nearly anything you can make in D&amp;D is appable at Planar Pathways. Since this is a pure -roleplay MUSH-based enviornment, with unique needs that differ from tabletop, videogames or mush, we have created a simplified (coded) combat system, more similiar to what you'll usually find on mushes, then the complex mechanics of 1st-3rd editions of D&amp;D, while fully incorporating and allowing for players to app almost anything from any edition.</desc>
    <desc>We hope to see you there.</desc>

    <desc>In the early 1600s three very different families with three very different secrets settled on the north shore of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Four hundred years later their legacy lives on in Devilshire, Massachusetts, a town driven by the local university, tourism, and a surprisingly large supernatural community. Its idyllic New England facade hides a dark past and an even darker future, if certain individuals and creatures about town have their way. While the locals couldn't necessarily put a finger on why they avoid going out at night, they know better than to question the instinct. After all, when the sun goes down, there is no pity for the unwary.</desc>
    <desc>Devilshire is a MUX set in the universe of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer. While familiarity with the television shows may be helpful it is not necessary. Our game wiki is very extensive and includes rules, characters, and a whole lot of extras. There are no Feature Characters on Devilshire, we deal with original characters; you shape the world around you and you are the heroes of our stories. Nobody the hell cares what Giles is doing and the game is not Slayer-centric, anyone can be the big star!</desc>
    <desc>A wide variety of character options are available including slayers, empowered warriors, demons, psychics, werewolves, magic users, and plain but never ordinary humans.</desc>

    <desc>Volunteers are welcome to help the game, like client programmers, artists. Remember, that all the stuff you make is free for everyone to use, Public Domain.</desc>
    <desc>The client itself is written in C, using the SDL library, so there might be a chance that the client can be compiled not only for Linux, but even Windows or OSX (volunteers for that are welcome).</desc>

    <desc>It's the unexplainable reason behind a multitude of natural disasters. It's the spark that makes the loyal husband go rampage and turn his anger on his wife and kids.</desc>
    <desc>It's the system-crash that causes the power to go out, or the hurricane that floods the suburbs.</desc>
    <desc>It's chaos, pure and simple, and its influence is noticeable everywhere to those in the know...</desc>
    <desc>In traditional Marvel history, it's well known that Jean Grey and Rachel Summers are the ones that received the Phoenix Force.</desc>
    <desc>However, this was a complete accident.</desc>
    <desc>Flame of Darkness focuses on the world of Marvel from the series X-Men: Evolution with influences from the X-Men movies, forming a well-rounded RolePlay experience.</desc>
    <desc>Instead of having Jean Grey obtain the Phoenix Force, it went to its rightful heir, Feron.</desc>
    <desc>But during the communal process, something went wrong and a shard of the Force was lost into the Earth.</desc>
    <desc>Years later, a construction crew uncovered it and unleashed it back into the world, tainted by the dark magic that tried to capture it years earlier.</desc>
    <desc>Meanwhile, the mutant phenomenon continues to grow, its secret getting more and more difficult to keep from the ever watching public eye.</desc>
    <desc>Those reaching the age that their powers manifest are at a point where they realise that they aren't alone, but still aren't sure where to turn.</desc>
    <desc>Aware of the threats against this ever-growing facet of mankind, Xavier put together a core group of his most talented students called the X-Men.</desc>
    <desc>They are protectors of normal humans and mutants alike, trained to use their fantastic abilities for the greater good.</desc>
    <desc>But even though their goals are to keep humanity from suffering at the hand of evil and chaos, they struggle just like everyone else.</desc>
    <desc>They know that as much as they want to, they cant risk exposing their status as a mutant to the public.</desc>
    <desc>This, and the fact that they all have mid-terms to study for can be quite a weight on any teenagers shoulders.</desc>

    <desc>Set at the series central location, Camp Half-Blood, young demigods train night and day as they prepare for upcoming quest....that is, if they can stay alive long enough. To make matters worse there are strange and dark omens on the air lately. The mist that keeps the mortal world ignorant of the gods and monsters is thinning and no one knows why. Despite more and more tabloids reporting monster and demon sightings on the streets, the mortals don't seem to have realized what is happening yet. Once more, the gods are divided about what to do. Some believe that it is the dawning of a new age and the return of the old ways, while others believe that an evil hand is at work and tossing the world out of balance. Some simply hold their tongue and wait for the chips to fall, but in the heart of Camp Half-Blood campers are worried. Will losing the protection of the mist mean mortals will be thrown to the claws of the monsters the half-blood and the gods fear most? And why are the barriers of the camp weakening?!</desc>
    <desc>Regardless of the whos, whats, and whys, there is no mistaking the truth. The world will soon need a new hero. Will it be you?</desc>
    <desc>+------------------------------+------------------------------+</desc>
    <desc>Players that are mature, responsible, and respectable RPers with an interest in a game that puts pose and RP quality right up there beside story development, we're looking for you!</desc>

    <desc>Once, a long time ago when the world was still young, humans dominated the lands of Tiran. What they did not know, was the true history behind the world. For you see, the humans were a non-magical race, who went on with their daily lives oblivious to the true power that swirled around them, that was of course, until those that are called gods were awoken. It was at that point in history, which nothing would ever be the same again.</desc>
    <desc>Even that day has almost been all but forgotten except in a few ancient manuscripts that lay around, and maybe an old tome or two. This here is one of those few remaining ones, to try and preserve the knowledge of what happened. Some of the details are a little unclear, since not everything is known, but what is certain, is that these gods changed the fate of Tiran, eventually leading to its shattering.</desc>
    <desc>What transpired between their return and the shattering is left to debate, but from that came a number of races. Some had been in hiding over the years, the rest was formed from their power, taking humans and slowly twisting them into new life forms, creating a new race of people to form armies to do their bidding. These new races began to show humans what magic meant, and what it could do, but it was of course the weakness of the human mind, that magic began to consume some, drawing them into an ever downward spiral of destruction.</desc>
    <desc>Because of that downward spiral, dark magic began to be explored, leeching the life from others, and causing things to become unnatural.  As some of these dark mages began to gain in power, that new power further consumed their minds and drove them into desiring more and more, until one day when Venoch was awakened, and the world of Tiran as it was known, was no more. Now that the Ashes of Tiran have settled, we that are left, must strive to revive civilization, before the armies of Venoch can cause the world to implode.</desc>

    <desc>Blood of Dragons is set in the low-magic, medieval-inspired fantasy world of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Knowledge of the books is not required for players with some MU*ing experience, though it is definitely helpful.</desc>
    <desc>The game takes place 140 years prior to the start of the first book, A Game of Thrones, and the roleplay is focused on the political and social interactions at the royal court in King's Landing and at the court in Sunspear in Dorne, with players taking up characters from various noble families. Players have a choice between CGing a character themselves or taking up previously played, fully pre-generated roles.</desc>
    <desc>Almost three years have now passed since King Daeron I, the Young Dragon, invaded and conquered Dorne, the last independent realm in Westeros. Now his chief commander in Dorne, Lord Tyrell, has been murdered and the fires of rebellion have begun to sweep across the desert.</desc>
    <desc>In light of this the Admin would love to see more PCs in Dorne, either Dornish natives or members of the Targaryen occupation forces. As roleplay in Dorne may be sporadic to start with, players who are interested in Dornish PCs are encouraged to also take up an alt in King's Landing, but this is by no means a requirement. While the broad outline of the events is already planned out, as the game will be following what canon knowledge there is about these events, the fates of individual characters are very much up to their players.</desc>

Charge an attack as long as you like or as long as your Ki can handle it and its power will reflect how long you gathered your energy. Melee attacks have a brief follow-through that require recovery, but higher speed gained through stat training allows you to recover faster.</desc>
    <desc>Roleplaying is greatly encouraged, and stories and sagas are run by our RP staff and quest imms. Special attacks, gear, and power up messages are available through RP rewards, allowing you to customize your character to your liking. Famous Dragonball characters are rare, however, as we prefer to make our world more unique and we urge our players to make their characters unique, as well.</desc>
    <desc>Our quest staff offers weekly and monthly quests, and personally tailored quests from certain IMMs, available when they are. Dragonballs, tournaments (both RP and code,) and other major events are scheduled every other month, and is tailored to appeal to all tiers and types of players.</desc>
    <desc>So come and join us in the Arena! Battle and lore all await you!</desc>

    <desc>The city of Santa Meringue is a thriving port of call, a major shipping hub into and out of the mediterranean continent of Valente. 1030 years after Holy, the citizens of Santa Meringue and Valente at large go about their day to day lives, wether in the fields harvesting argiculture or selling those goods in the thriving bazaar, the common folk of the city live and breathe and die by a series of endlessly repeating steps.  But there are those who chose more then the life of a laborer. Powerful mages study arcane energies in the University Spire. Adventurers of all shapes and sizes brave the wilds to keep the land safe from the monsters and villans that inhabit Gaia.  And within Valente itself, the Noble Houses plot and scheme agaisnt each other, grasping to curry favor with the government.  Your place in the city is up to you, your fate is in your own hands.  You find yourself walking in the forest, and there is a blur of light...  The music plays...</desc>

    <desc>The Cullens moved to Forks in the early year 2000, their children starting up at School later that same year. Life was peaceful, they lived their lives amongst the humans like many vampires have to do; but with a different spin. It wasn't until year 2004 that Forks started to get interesting. The arrival of Bella Swan heralded many changes for Forks and the surrounding area, as with the time that Edward Cullen fell in love with the humans, a number of supernaturals started to come to pass... and stay. Werewolves started coming out of the woodworks, Shifters began to become awakened, and the Vampire community increased by a large number.</desc>
    <desc>Of course.. the humans don't know this. Times went onward with many silent battles fought for the sake of peace and keeping their supernatural secret; James was killed, a year later his mate Victoria followed his fate. Others that came to stir the pot were put to rest by another force, or came to live in relative peace with the strange hub of supernatural activity.</desc>
    <desc>The focus of this large group started to spread to Port Angeles in early 2006, even further increasing the ratio of supernaturals against the humans in the area. Late 2007, the Volturi started to take action against the indiscretions of vampires in the area. They took up a temporary headquarters in Port Angeles, rumored to be two of the three ancients that were there for a time, one for a good portion of the duration. Only the Volturi and a small number of Vampires know if this was true or not. Early 2008, however, it seems the ancient vampiric royalty was satisfied, and returned to Volterra, Italy; but they left in their wake a number of Volturi to act as the Supernatural police to make sure that things don't get out of hand in the future.</desc>
    <desc>Thankfully, things were quiet for nearly two years; the missing persons died down to a low minimum even for human activity, the deaths have been few as well. At least, nothing out of the ordinary. However, it is now year 2010, and with the new year brings new possibilities. Will the Supernaturals invoke another looming Volturi presence? Will a war break out between the factions?</desc>
    <desc>Stay tuned, and join us, for the story is still being written...</desc>

    <desc>Rawhide Buttes has been a camping and hunting ground for natives for centuries. Rumor has it that a white settler bragged of killing an 'Injun' during his excursion in the west. He was warned of the folly by his own people, to no avail. The young white man killed a Cheyenne woman. The other indians in the area came down on the camp and demanded they surrender the murderer to their hand. The rest of the party,  having no other choice, was forced to comply. The story goes on to say that the young man was skinned and his hide was stretched to dry in the sun. Thus, the mountain was named Rawhide Buttes, sometimes called Rawhide Mountain.  Rawhide is based in what is now called Goshen County, Wyoming. This region contains the Rawhide Buttes range, and the Little Tetons, with sprawling valleys and beautiful scenery.  The theme is still being developed. Please be patient.</desc>

    <desc>Credit for some ideas goes to these great muds I used to play: Ashen Dust Asgardian Nightmare Calindrian Council</desc>
    <desc>We are somewhere between player testing and fully open.  I have no plans for any pwipes, so anything you accomplish you can keep.  I just finished reorganizing the current skills and spells and am now getting ready to work on the group costs.  Also have plenty of new skills I would like to add once I finish cleaning up all the existing ones.</desc>
    <desc>I am thinking about hiring a few builders, but I would prefer to have builders who are currently playing so they can have some sense of the balance of the MUD.  I have plenty of areas that need a good retooling / looking over or if you prefer you can build new areas.</desc>
    <desc>Key Points For Players:</desc>
    <desc>Forge System - Allows players to collect metal stone types and forge their own equipment.</desc>
    <desc>Quest System - Everyone should be familiar with this by now.</desc>
    <desc>Global Quest System - Similar to normal quests, but with multiple mobs and allows multiple players to partake.</desc>
    <desc>Arena System - Allows players to fight each other without fear of losing anything.  Has many advanced options for disallowing certain skills and items.  Allows teams or solo efforts.</desc>
    <desc>Spam Toggles - Allows many messages considered by many as spam to be blocked from your screen.</desc>
    <desc>Advanced Aliases - Allows multiple command substitutions.</desc>
    <desc>PK System - PK rules automated to prevent illegal interference. Looting point system installed for looting to limit looting of harder to obtain items. (5 points per corpse)</desc>
    <desc>PK Records - Automatic saving of all your kills / deaths and the opponents you were fighting including level / clan.</desc>
    <desc>Multiple Scores - 5 separate score screens for customization.</desc>
    <desc>Item Storage - Can store extra equipment in the various banks.</desc>
    <desc>Top Charts - Shows top ranking players in various categories.</desc>
    <desc>Checkstat Command - Can dump the contents of various game_tables to see stats on races / classes / skills / groups / etc.</desc>
    <desc>Mobile AI - Some mobiles act more like players and less like punching bags.</desc>
    <desc>Automated Clans - All the clan building is done by the players and not the Immortals.  I find this works out best for everyone.</desc>

    <desc>Let the warhorns blow! The fantasy world of Uthrac is littered with original landscapes with new spins on the time-tested races we have all become accustomed to finding in fantasy settings. The scope of the game's story focuses on the small kingdom of Tier in the lands of Albiane. Tier is a monarchal society, whose kingly line over the years has slowly weakened. The prince Tornoah is all that remains of the once powerful kings of the past. The Tieran nobility squabbles in dimly lit council chambers, each following their own mechinations to gain an upper hand over their rivals. Here, corruption and abuse have become all too common. The general population of the kingdom live their lives in peace, minding their own business, and working the wheat and barley fields that surround Tier. Silver can be had for those willing to take the risks of prospecting in the nearby Ambros Mountains.</desc>
    <desc>To Tier's south lies the fortified city of Kael, once an outpost of Tier, now a strong military bastion. Both city states exist alongside one another in a strained peace. Not long ago Kael's army sacked the city of Tier after the Tieran king Kardan III had their leader General Kael, the fort's namesake, assassinated. After 10 years the Tieran exiles returned however, and retook their city, reestablishing their old borders. Continued border skirmishes exist between the cities, and all-out war threatens the thinly brokered peace.</desc>
    <desc>While western lands fight petty wars over land and honor, deep in the Dragon Mountains far to the east, evil begins to stir. The Matron Mother, vanquished following the fall of Tier, has been reborn by the magic of Lacatus, a powerful necromancer. Her banners fly once again, carried by throngs of orc, goblin, and dagashi armies. Villages are once again being overrun, with fresh slaves pouring in to the Matron's Undermountain City. Some for food, and others as laborers, over time being corrupted themselves by the dark magics of the Matron.</desc>
    <desc>Follow the path of light, and fend against the encroaching evil, or take up the dark blood-stained banner of the Matron Mother! Whichever side you choose, prepare for WAR!</desc>

Players can venture into the world as vampires, liches, or werewolves, or play as a cleric who must now additionally chose a deity to worship. Realms also offers multi-class combinations, such as cleric/assassins or fighter/thieves, and pioneered many improvements that are now standard in Mordor, such as player shops and guilds.</desc>
    <desc>The world of Derlith is large and is still unfolding. There are many areas open for players to explore, from underground mazes to tropical islands to glacier palaces. Additionally, we are currently developing racial starting locations, which will add a new angle to character creation and promote roleplaying among our character base.</desc>

    <desc>Hogwarts, 2027 is a MUX/MUSH set some thirty years after the events which take place in the Deathly Hallows. Harry Potter is now-- after years of being an auror-- the headmaster at Hogwarts, and the Wizarding World has, for years now, enjoyed a period of relative peace since the fall of the dark wizard, Voldemort. But there are stirrings of a darkness. Something is restless; something unclean. Something which stirs beneath the surface. Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry is again the target of that something, as is the wizarding world at large. Only the faintest hints have rippled the placid peace, and only a few have noticed those ripples. We're looking for players of both students and adults, at Hogwarts and in the adult, wizarding world. We have spheres for the school, the Ministry, the Underground, and more. We have helpful, friendly staff, and we look to weave a story where the players are involved, and can make a difference. If you're looking for a home and are a fan of the HP Universe, look no further. We are still finishing up newsfiles, but have most of them in place at this point, and room descs are being added slowly to a fairly large initial grid, but we are now open for play. Feel free to drop by and take a look. The battle against the dark awaits.</desc>

    <port>6661</port>
    <ip>72.52.136.221</ip>
    <www>http://</www>
    <desc>Based in a fictious futuristic world, InfoTech aims to bring an immersive experience to life rather than an actual story. InfoTech takes a nod at realistic gameplay while shunning away from any such restrictions that would spoil gameplay. Rather than having a story, the world is presented as is and players are let to participate in and shape its future. Large events will be run and players' actions will shape their outcome and their affect on the game world.</desc>
    <desc>InfoTech as a MUD emphesizes on innovation and multifunctionality. We aim to create a plethora of game mechanics in order to avoid the tedium of simply fighting mobs to gain 'levels'. Our greatest goal is to allow a player to reach the top of the field without fighting a single fight, if so he chooses to do.</desc>
    <desc>Other than that, we're revamping most of the stock systems. * Levels have been done away with and are replaced with a stat system which determines your skills and equipment. That one, in turn, increases with use and reflects the type of character you are playing. Those who choose to use psionics will be more powerful at their mental attributes while the fighters will find their physical ones to be higher. * Classes and races have been done away with in order to allow players to truly be whatever they wish to be via their actions rather than the choices they made during creation. This allows a virtually infinite amount of multiclassing. * Due to the fact that there are no classes and any character can have any skill, a special skill system has been implemented. Players have to plan their strategy before heading into combat as they can only carry a limited amount of skills and programs (programs are in InfoTech what spells are in normal medieval MUDs). This forces players to have variety (rather than have everyone be the exact same), while still allowing anyone to do anything. Of course, those who mainly use psionics will find it easier to use than those not trained in it. Esentially, players decide their class by the program set they choose at any given moment, and are able to change it at their discretion. * Combat has been revamped and improved with more work still planned for it. Esentially, the minor annoyances of stock Circle combat have been done away with (such as command lag via the use of a special energy gauge), and many of the calculations and hidden variables have been removed in order to make a more straightforward and reliable combat system. * AC is gone, thank god. Instead, dodge is actually based on one's dexterity, while his armor actually absorbs damage rather than allow the player to dodge it better. Damage is divided into various types, and each armor protects for the better or for the worse against that specific damage type. Furthermore, limb damage is planned to be implemented, allowing for more strategic combat.</desc>
    <desc>And more features are constantly planned and added to fulfill the main goal of truly standing out among other MUDs via innovation.</desc>
    <desc>** The mud is currently in early stages of development, so players won't have much of a world to see yet. Builders, however, are heartilly encouraged to drop by or to drop us a mail.</desc>

    <desc>But the mud was closed down for a while.After a long period of downtime the mud is reopen again for players under a new look and with new Owners and Immortals, and with a new site. Allow me to describe a little bit this mud :</desc>
    <desc>One of the most outstanding parts of our mud is random item generation. It works like the items in Diablo 2, where an item is assigned prefixes and suffixes that give it extra stat bonuses or drawbacks.</desc>
    <desc>With a huge number of prefixes and suffixes, as well as condition tags, there are literally millions of possibilities for random items. Builders are constantly working on new areas, so the mud is constantly evolving. We offer three tiers of classes, with 21 third tier classes to choose from, and the option to let your race evolve into one of many new races as you gain experience.</desc>

    <desc>For those of you who dont know. GodWars: Apocalypse was created in 1997 by myself(Tijer) and Shimian, after working there for a year i left and went off to make my own MUDS. In August 2006 i was given a copy of Apocalypse from 2002, by one of its coders and Majorly modified that code, which caught the eye of Zoth, one of the coders who had recoded Apocalypse, to cut a long story short he gave me permission to run a copy of the code  from 2004, which then became Rebirth of Apocalypse.  We are NOW GodWars Apocalypse to all of our players!</desc>
    <desc>Rebirth of Apocalypse features the following classes: Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, Magi and Highlanders.  Each of which has what the classes have usually on godwars. Mages and Highlanders have been recoded, to give them more powers, and more scope for change.</desc>
    <desc>Along with Hybrids: Abomination(WW/Vampire), Tremere(Mage/Vampire), Baali (Demon/Vampire), Nephandi(Demon/Mage), Skindancer(WW/Mage) and Black Spiral Dancer (WW/Demon). You can hybrid yourself using the selfbrid command for a cost.</desc>
    <desc>We have added a PK arena where players can test their skills at PKILL without the worry of losing status or gaining a death.  Players can bet on arenas using quest points and if the person they bet on wins, they gain qps + the payoff from the bet.  We have also recently added Wars, where players can win quest points, and status.  There are currently 2 types, Team Wars or Last Man Standing.</desc>
    <desc>Rebirth of Apocalypse also has Renown, which gives players a statcap boost, and damcap boost, we also have recoded how status affects statcaps, players can gain hp/mana/move, but when they lose status their stats lower, regaining status brings them back to where they were.</desc>
    <desc>Tired of your clan leader, challenge them for their leadership in arena, and if you win, you get their leader position.</desc>
    <desc>Fed up with having 100's of Quest cards in your inventory? You can now upgrade your quest cards for a cost, to a maximum for 1000 points!!</desc>
    <desc>Rebirth of Apocalypse does what it says on the tin, its the Rebirth of the MUD called GodWars: Apocalypse, come join us! We are not just a MUD, we are a way of life!</desc>
    <desc>We now have a facebook group visit us @ http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=287464174074  apoc.godwars.net 6660 - Rebirth of Apocalypse - Its not just a MUD, its a way of life!</desc>

    <desc>Lost in the mists of time and space the world of Srinoka awaits the adventureous souls of the spirit plane to come fight for peace or bring glorious war to the lands.  The eternal conflict between good and evil plays itself out weaving a tapestry of many colors and wonderful patterns in time.  Let the hero in you do the great things you were destined for in Srinoka.</desc>
    <desc>Epic is an LPMud that is based on the Amylaar driver.  It starts in Srinoka a land that is peaceful.  From here you can adventure the lands that follow a fantasy setting that is medieval in type but not exactly.  There are quests to do and equipment to chase after.  Many NPC's both good and evil are there to kill in plenty.  Skills which encompass spells are available to all classes but are really hard to level up outside of your class.  You can train skills up to a certain level and to max it out you have to use it.  I encourage you to use clients like tintin++ etc. or whatever is the latest. However movement requires you to type directions which are short like e for east etc. and you cannot move 10 steps in one shot with a client.  I am working on making this possible.  The mud is under continuous development and contributions from players is highly encouraged.  There is mud documentation available for the rest of the features of the mud.  Even though this is an LPMud I have encorportard lots of Diku features into it.  Eventually it will support all the features offered by a Diku mud as well in addition to the LPMud style custom interface it has.</desc>

    <desc>Inner circle is an all around fun and creative MUD to play on. It is a fantasy based world full of elves, dwarfs, giants, and all sorts of other fantasy mobs.  The mud recently reopened in January of 2010, and hopes to build up a nice player base.  Roleplay is encouraged among characters and there are channels for everything from out of character talk, in character talk, to clan talk, gossiping, emoting and so fourth.  Clans are options, but allow people who want to go PK to do so.  The mud also features Relics, special items which allow you to fully heal you hp, mana, move, high level spells etc, which are the main things clans fight each other to get.  They drop when you log out, so they must be guarded in order to keep them.  More features will be added soon. And of course, skilled builders/coders are welcome to help this great MUD continue to grow.</desc>
    <desc>Inner Circle has a lot of amazing features some of which are: -200 Level system -19 Races -13 Classes -Reroll/Remort System -Mob driven quest system -Immortal run quests as well -50+ linked areas -Mining, Fabrication, Spellbinding system to make your own equipment -Hundreds of spells/skills to learn -Optional Clans/Player Killing -Mud School for beginner's</desc>

    <desc>Mass Effect is a universe of exploration, adventure, and intrigue. Whether you want to be a notorious pirate who lives beyond the reach of the law or a political leader of free worlds, there's something for you.  With nearly limitless thematic content to draw upon based on two books and a hugely successful video game, Mass Effect is a science fiction universe that's ripe for enjoyment.</desc>
    <desc>The creator of the original Underworld MUSH is pleased to present Mass Effect MUSH, a game that has been in development for over two years.  A rich plethora of completely original systems awaits our players, from the ability to carry on conversations with NPCs to a dynamic commodity trade market accessible through the latest version of HSpace.  Almost every line of code has been written specifically for this game, and we've reached a place where it would be beneficial to have players willing to stress test these systems as even more features are implemented.</desc>

    <desc>GreaterMUD has been in development for over three years now and an enormous amount of effort has gone into this project to make sure it looks and feels just like MajorMUD.  It is 100% MegaMUD compatible so legacy MajorMUD players will be right at home getting around the realm.  For those that don't know what MegaMUD is, it is a very well written client program designed specifically to help MajorMUD players navigate the realm and allow AFK scripting.</desc>
    <desc>Almost all the major functionality has been completed and has been well tested.  Version 1.0 is scheduled to be released in January of 2009.  Please feel free to stop by to check out our realm, and be sure to visit our forums for more information.</desc>

    <name>The Second City: 1920's Chicago by Night</name>
    <codebase>[Custom] Custom</codebase>
    <host>projectfiction.net</host>
    <port>1926</port>
    <www>http://roaringtwenties.wikidot.com</www>
    <desc>The Second City, Chicago by Night is a heavily immersive role-playing game set in the Old World of Darkness and Chicago, Illinois of 1926. The mortal world is blighted by the dark underbelly of organized crime as two battling Princes wage war for Domain of the city proper. Torn down the middle, Chicago is separated by the North and South; as power ploys between the Camarilla Courts devolve toward desperation the mob families of the city grow increasingly violent and segregated from their would-be comrades in the war against Prohibition.</desc>
    <desc>Al \"Scarface\" Capone and the South Side Gang maintain tight control over vast numbers of the human population as the sinister Ghoul of the Brujah Prince in South Chicago. In the North, Bugs Moran's North Side Gang springs up criminal enterprises to counter his southern rival, powered by the strong blood and acute manipulations of the Nosferatu Prince. As the Kindred puppeteers set the stages and pull the strings, the mortal world is wracked by a seemingly endless timeline of violence, fear and unusual economic prosperity.</desc>
    <desc>The Second City features Vampire: The Masquerade, Mage: The Ascension and Mortal+ Numinists in a true-to-life tabletop gaming environment. We have no coded mobs to kill, no leveling and no autoquests to run. In-Character chronicles are written as you go. To prevent surprises for new players, an average pose-length runs at a four to six sentence paragraph. Some players do a little more or a little less, but either way one must expect to write - and write as well as they can - while weaving together friendships, vendettas, forging alliances, making enemies and composing the epic tales which encompass character progression. We never ask for perfection - just effort.</desc>
    <desc>We feature comfortable MUD-style commands with the role-play niceties of a MUSH, and have frequent code revisions and changes to smooth out bumps in the system. Our community forum allows ideas, custom material and game mechanic debates to flow freely between pbase and staff. The community wiki project is one of the best Old World of Darkness resources on the web (membership approval required), and undergoes constant additions by both players and staff. XP is rewarded weekly based upon RP recommendations made by other players, but XP may also be gained by contributing to the community wiki project. Combat is run almost solely by volunteer player-storytellers (one person is nominated or volunteers themselves when a scene requires a switch to combat), though there is a full Staff in place to mediate or run scenes in which there is no one comfortable enough with combat to run it. Anywhere Rooms fill in the blanks between coded locations on the Chicago grid, allowing players to run scenes, Storylines and Chronicles anywhere - any city, country or dimension - they choose.</desc>
    <desc>The Second City is a new game. We are still in the process of attempting to accumulate a sound playerbase, so don't be discouraged by brief periods of inactivity. During our busy hours there are typically 8-10 players online and In-Character. Applications take an average of 24 hours for reviewal and approval. Any new blood is good blood, so come give us a try - we'd be glad to help you get to know the game.</desc>

    <desc>In the 3rd century BC, Rome started its conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, but focusing only their strength there after the end of Punic Wars. The invasion progressed quite well in its initial phases, conquering most of the peninsulae with relative ease.</desc>
    <desc>The consul Servius Sulpicius Galba commanded the Roman troops in Iberia circa 150 BC and started destroying the rest of the Lusitan resistance. Fearing the destruction of their lands, the Lusitans sent an embassy to him. Galba received the Lusitan embassy politely, suspended the offensive and promised to give lands to the Lusitanian people.</desc>
    <desc>The offer turned out to be a trap. When the unarmed Lusitanians tried to reclaim the lands promised by Galba, a massacre happened and many were killed. Viriathus was among those who escaped.</desc>
    <desc>Viriathus never forgot the Roman treachery. Later, when some Lusitanian leaders prepared to make a new agreement with the Romans after a major loss of lives to the Roman army, Viriathus reminded them of Galba's trick and proposed a Lusitanian War against the Romans. The Lusitanians cried with joy.</desc>
    <desc>Viriathus organized an attack against enemy's legions. Since the Romans were better armed, he organized guerrilla tactics and sprung imaginative ambushes. Charging with iron spears, short swords and roars, the Lusitanians clashed and defeated many enemy armies, keeping Iberia Peninsula free from Roman control.</desc>

    <desc>The sister mud of Dragonball Arena, Dragonball Xtreme (formally Dragonball Arena2) has been up since 2000, and runs a unique codebase that has been mimicked but never perfectly copied, where nothing in combat is automated. Charge an attack as long as you like or as long as your Ki can handle it and its power will reflect how long you gathered your energy.</desc>
    <desc>Roleplaying is greatly encouraged, and stories and sagas are run by our RP staff and quest imms. Special attacks, gear, and power up messages are available through RP rewards, allowing you to customize your character to your liking. Famous Dragonball characters are rare, however, as we prefer to make our world more unique and we urge our players to make their characters unique, as well.</desc>
    <desc>Our quest staff offers monthly quests, and personally tailored quests from certain IMMs, available when they are. Dragonballs, tournaments (both RP and code,) and other major events are scheduled every other month, and is tailored to appeal to all tiers and types of players.</desc>

For the man of action, the sports arena features local teams, blood events and animal racing(Chocobos are especially popular beasts for betting rings). For the more sophisticated, Highwind's shopping and leisure areas are clean and stocked with exotic goods from both Gaia bound merchants and visiting alien species. Heroes of Space is an Adventure game set in a Soft Sci Fi universe. The action centers on Highwind Station, a recently constructed outpost for the people of Gaia, whom are, galactically speaking, quite new to the entire space going idea. Being a world of magic, their technology tends to show it, with dirty shortcuts taken wherever magic would work as well. Even their bodies require magic to function properly, which necessitates magic reserves just as important as fuel depots, limiting the range of the Gaian people. This has not muted their thirst for excitement and profit, however, and the risk is well worth the prizes out there in the hostile spaces. Are you ready to be a hero? All types welcome. Few heroes are entirely clean. Most are in it for themselves on one level or another. What's your angle? Sign the dotted line with Odin Industries and we won't pry much further. You make us profit, and we'll keep your ship running. It's quite a deal! A fair warning, Heroes of Space is currently Open Beta. What does this mean: The values of given powers or ship parts may adjust, new code may come into existence, old code may fade away if it proves it can't work. Rules are being tested, and are not wrought in stone, or even terribly hardened clay. What it does not mean: Your actions don't mean anything. They do, the story is officially launched with this prologue chapter. You WILL be able to take the character you make and move forward into the non beta of the game without losing your stuff.</desc>

    <www>http://eoemud.com</www>
    <desc>The Evolution of Esos is a role-play intensive world where you immerse yourself in the character of your choosing. Role-play in this game world is not only accepted but strictly enforced. The EoE Staff is highly interactive with the player base, both In Character and Out of Character, in an effort to assist the mud in its development. The events in the mud unfold not unlike a storybook,  authored by YOU, the player. In this story you will become your  character, having adventures untold and living your days in a  fantastic, highly descriptive and expansive game world.</desc>
    <desc>Although the mud is completely functional, it is still being developed each and every day, with more additions planned for the  future, and can be expected in some manner on a daily basis, whether it be descriptions, special request items, or just about anything your mind can think up that fits into the gameworld. Through the combined effort of the community of players and the staff, the mud itself will always be a work in progress, as we strive to create something bold and unique in flavor. Such additions include vast area building, code changes, new races, mobs, objects and plots. The EoE Staff is quite willing to tailor specific objects to player needs, as valuable role-playing tools or resources from the character s background. The work that you put into your character is more valuable to us than the little time that it takes to craft an object to assist in your role-playing experience, so this is done quickly and with ease. We appreciate YOUR effort as players, parts of the evergrowing tale, and fellow roleplayers.</desc>
    <desc>Players start out by choosing a class, representing the inborn talents. From there, the sky's the limit. Players can learn anything, including hunting, bow shooting, horseback riding, carriage piloting, fishing, swimming, mining for different metals, taking those metals and forging them into useful weapons, an extensive crafting system that allows you to create everything from a simple threading needle to an elaborate tribal headdress, farming, lock smithing, climbing, swimming, guarding, and bartering. The list goes on and on, ending with a very unique magic system. However, just like in real life, if you spread yourself too far and too thin, you shouldn't expect to become a professional. The only skills that a character can NOT learn, are skills based on a magical class, which is restricted to that class and that class alone. This skill system allows the player to truly tailor their characters to their own experiences and their physical abilities and talents will grow and thrive based on what you do, how often, and how intensely you roleplay each and every situation you find yourself in.</desc>
    <desc>EoE is not a hack-n-slash MUD. Roleplaying is strictly enforced according to the documentations and timeline, and appropriate guidelines provided on this webpage. This does NOT mean that you cannot go against the grain! It will however show you what the average elf knows and expects to see, making a character that 'goes against the grain' more informed and playable. We suggest you read the parts of the webpage that are most likely where you want to take your character in game. As things grow and change, more will be added: skills, magic, items, beasts... you can expect that at least five new items, five new npc's, and five new rooms will be added on a daily basis. Plot movement is done on an eighty percent player-driven level. Beyond that, recommended playtimes and such, are open ended. We have no expectations on how such times come out, and have a wide variety of tools at are disposal to keep things moving. You will have fun! You will have a say! Your character will have an impact!</desc>
    <desc>***********************DISCLAIMER************************* The Evolution of Esos sometimes contains adult oriented material, including violence and sometimes sexually graphic material.  It is the staff policy for all players to be eighteen years of age. *****************************************************************</desc>

The Intergalactic Space Police struggle against the invading forces of Crimson Imperium, while the Alliance of Free Trade (space pirates) eat at their very core, taking what they want and leaving nothing in their wake.  To make matters even worse, Sereitei, home of the benevelant Shinigami, as well as Hueco Mundo, home of the wretched Hollow, have both been taken over, pushing both into our world.  Unique races and attacks, options of open PVP training areas (with increased rewards) and closed PVP training areas, fully custom areas, and more await you on the adventure you'll never forget!</desc>

    <desc>Summer of 2012 has begun. Most of the Gods have laid claim to their errant children by now, most demigods know of their parentage. Summer has been particularly harsh -- restless. The monster are becoming more and more unbearable, forcing more and more demigods to Camp Halfblood to avoid getting eaten. There's something ominous in the air something stirring. The Gods, aware of this, have sent Percy, Annabeth, and Grover out on a scouting mission into the world as the camp's most decorated heroes. Something big is coming.</desc>
    <desc>Something wicked comes this way.</desc>

The time to make a hero, or even a villain, is now.</desc>
