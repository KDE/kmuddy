TODO-list:
----------

add zlib checks to cmakefile

Keyboard shortcuts not loaded properly?

Fix bell to go through knotify. Make other things (global notify etc) go through knotify as well.

'Duplicate' object functionality

Problem with prompt detection triggers: I have a script to append some stuff after my prompt and if I want it to be printed I have to add a \n to my script and I think the space at the beginning of the following line is the go ahead signal since I already added a new line to print my script output and the prompt. 
 
The Enabled/Disabled function for macro keys doesn't appear to work. Whether the function is enabled or disabled, the client captures the key and sends in the command. 

/notify can't handle UTF8.

Saving shortcuts supposedly doesn't work, check it out.

Document advanced transcript !!!

MSP: when more matches for a file exist and more repeats are requested,
file should be randomly chosen for each iteration. Currently, it's chosen
only once.

MSP: directory creation does not work !!!

variables should not get expanded in the password for auto-login (hmpf)

- = smaller feature
? = not sure if I'll do this
----------
* speed-walking improvements: slow-walking, detecting invalid moves, ... (12.8.2003 by Alex Bache)
  / probably a part of mapper?
- notification improvements (don't notify gags, MUD-specific settings, notify-all-but) (29.8.2003 by Orion Elder)

  / big change - for or after 1.0
- allow disabling MCCP in a profile (23.1.2004 by Saurag)
- allow using F1 in macros (11.2.2004 by Ardanwen)

- variable that if set, redirects output to another window (4.11.2004 by Alex Bache)
- prompt bar's font and color should be changeable (5.11.2004 by Gopher)
  / see also a similar wish higher (from 4.5.2004)

  / will be doable with some /text macro

- triggers that only match if the text has a certain color (5.10.2005 by Magnus)
- convenience: change background color of active tab (3.12.2005 by Ken Rosser)
