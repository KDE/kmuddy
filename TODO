This is a TODO list for KMuddy.

TODO-list:
----------

add zlib checks to cmakefile

Keyboard shortcuts not loaded properly?

Fix bell to go through knotify. Make other things (global notify etc) go through knotify as well.

'Duplicate' object functionality

Problem with prompt detection triggers: I have a script to append some stuff after my prompt and if I want it to be printed I have to add a \n to my script and I think the space at the beginning of the following line is the go ahead signal since I already added a new line to print my script output and the prompt. 
 
The Enabled/Disabled function for macro keys doesn't appear to work. Whether the function is enabled or disabled, the client captures the key and sends in the command. 

/notify can't handle UTF8.

Segfault fix:

Document advanced transcript !!!

MSP: when more matches for a file exist and more repeats are requested,
file should be randomly chosen for each iteration. Currently, it's chosen
only once.

MSP: directory creation does not work !!!

4dimensions.org 6000 - nothing displayed iff both MCCP and MXP on

variables should not get expanded in the password for auto-login (hmpf)
