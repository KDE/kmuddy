2003-05-23
* implemented autoconf tests for SDL_mixer and libartskde

* modified that script above to use libtool for testing; prevents problems
  with missing .la files, that are needed by libtool but standard autoconf
  checks don't need them
* SOUND SUPPORT IS NOW CONFIGURABLE!!! (but SDL not implemented yet)

2003-05-18
* finished #ifdef-ing of everything sound-related
* started updating configure script to detect libartskde/SDL_mixer

2003-05-16

* implemented dialogs that can be used to set timers

2003-05-09
* implemented class cTimerList, that manages timers

  directories

2003-04-11
* applied patch from Alex Bache that fixes scripting when a lot of text
  is to be sent to a script
* applied some things from Alex Bache's patch that greatly improve redrawing
  performance and also solve problems when too much text arrives after
  history size has been reached (most of this patch was not applied though,
  as it had problems with output cache and wordwrapping)

2003-04-04
* fixed a bug in Edit Profile dialog - empty lines in connection sequence
  are no longer wiped out

* tabs can now be switched using keyboard; default keybindings are
  alt+pgup/pgdn and alt+number

2003-03-28
* added more functionality to the MSP parser; tokenization, file finding,
  choosing random file on multiple matches
* implemented class cDownloader
* implemented support for downloading sounds/music
* Ha! Most of MSP support works! It can parse triggers, search for files,
  download them from remote server if possible. The only two missing things
  are dialogs for configuring it and playing the sound via aRts

* implemented Reconnect option
* I hope I've finally fixed the crash when using KDE 3.1

2003-03-09
* implemented all important parts of the Advanced trigger dialog that are
  needed for colorizations
* fixed some bugs in colorization code
* COLOR TRIGGERS WORK!!!

2003-03-08
* started implementing the Advanced trigger dialog (colorizations and such)

2003-03-07
* fixed some bugs in cTrigger::prepareColorizationArrays

2003-03-02

* implemented most of back-end color trigger support in cTrigger class

2003-02-28
* applied fix from Yui Unifex to support telnet-style pasting
* applied fix from Carsten Nikiel that improves flashing and modified it
  to be more KDE-complaint
* had to keep that old blinking stuff for global blinking, because the
  Modified icon does not show correctly if using translated KDE (it looks
  for translated version of [modified] string but KMuddy is in English and
  it uses original non-translated string) :-(
* size of history buffer in console is now configurable, default 1000
  
2003-02-27
* implemented cConsole::colorizeLastLine and cConsole::dumpBuffer

2003-02-23
* when connection closes, it's now possible to close that tab by pressing
  the ENTER key
* history size is now 5000

2003-02-22
* found a bug in MCCP code
* MCCP WORKS!!!
* cMCCP class now counts size of compressed and uncompressed data
* If multiple tabs are active and one connection closes, the tab no longer
  closes automatically (prevents loss of output)

2003-02-21
* continuing work on MCCP support, finished writing class cMCCP, class
  needs testing
* the new MCCP code now compiles successfully, but it still doesn't work :(

2003-02-15
* started work on MCCP support

2003-02-14
* Terminal ID is now also sent to AFKMud that doesn't implement it correctly
* ANSI color codes are now saved correctly in session transcript

2003-02-11
* RELEASED VERSION 0.4.1

2003-02-07
* KMuddy 0.4.1 ready for release - created tarballs and Mandrake RPMs

2003-02-06
* added support for italics, underline and strikeout text attributes
  (: italics only works if the font supports it :)
* added support for negative image
* also added support for rapid blink (treated as normal blink), faint
  (treated as bold off), gothic (treated as italics) and double underline
  (treated as single underline)
* KMuddy now supports all important ANSI color codes (everything except
  10-19 (alternative fonts), 26 (proportional spacing), 38 (special fg
  color), 48 (special bg color), 50 (proportional spacing off) and codes > 50
  (special effects like framed, encircled, overlined and so...).
  It's unlikely that I'll ever support these codes.
* ANSI color support is now considered complete. :)

2003-02-05
* auxiliary console no longer hides some text after historySize has
  been reached
* KMuddy no longer crashes when aux. console is shown in the moment when
  historySize is reached
* auxiliary console historySize has been reduced (you never see more than
  last few lines, so it's not needed to waste memory on this)
* auxiliary console no longer uses cache - it's not big enough to take
  advantage of it, so it was just another waste of memory

2003-02-04
* auxiliary console now behaves almost correctly
* fixed some problems with blinking
* Blinking works!
* New profile dialog now includes default login sequence
* updated web page (local copy only)
* updated user manual

2003-02-03
* implemented support for blinking, further testing required

2003-02-02
* Login sequence can now be customized (profile-based connections only)

2003-01-31
* Whole words matching in aliases is now optional
* occasional crashes when terminating with an active connection should
  no longer occur ( I hope, I couldn't reproduce this :( )
* \\n is no longer treated as \ followed by \n
* when BS expansion in AT only was enabled, alias A -> B existed and
  command A\nC was entered, that \n was treated as command separator because
  of the alias expansion. Fixed. (using an ugly hack - protecting backslashes
  that shouldn't be expanded by replacing them with \x01 then back)
* backslash expansion should now work correctly in all cases
    
2003-01-30
* fixed some bugs in code added yesterday; updated command parsing now
  works properly
* trigger loop detection and multi-command limit can now be disabled
* KMuddy no longer crashes when adding a new alias/trigger without choosing
  its group (sometimes it failed to set it to BASE)
* implemented support for word wrapping
  
2003-01-29
* code cleanup in class cCmdProcessor
* some new features in class cCmdProcessor (multi-char separator, backslashes
  for aliases/trigers only and more (thanks to Orion Elder for these ideas)

* added method cProfiles::duplicateProfile
* implemented GUI for profile duplication
* profile duplication now works properly
* fixed bug in multi-command alias expansion
* added support for sending tabulators (by typing \t) (but they are not
  displayed correctly when we receive them :-( )
* commands can now be also separated with \n character
* '\' character can be sent by doubling it

2003-01-21
* fixed some scripting-related crashes that I've discovered
* single-instance scripts now work properly
* updated user manual to include all the new features

  to the user manual

2003-01-20
* implemented dialog Running scripts, which lists all running scripts and
  contains GUI for manipulating scripts

* added notification when script has finished and when it couldn't be started
* fixed updating of alias/trigger groups dialog when connection closes
* SCRIPTING WORKS!!! Now that's excellent. :-))) 0.4 will be out soon :-)

2003-01-18
* added getFirstId() and getNextId() to cRunningList. Now I'm ready to code
  the running scripts dialog that'll manage them

2003-01-15

  and some text arrives)
* implemented functions in cRunningList that manage scripts

2003-01-14
* added support for default script location/working directory

  and script name must be unique (so that you can run it from input line)

2003-01-13
* all script options are now saved correctly
* looks like scripts work well now, but running script manager is still
  missing (something that can suspend/resume/terminate... them)
* scripts now support default script locations

2003-01-11
* added option to send a command multiple times (e.g. #10 smile sends 10
  times smile). Thanks to David Ortega Tamayo for this.
* sending only matched text to script now works
* only-if-match script option works as well

2003-01-07
* fixed handling of invisible text in cConsole::addCommand and friends
* scripts can now send commands or show their output

* implemented class cRunningList, made the whole stuff compilable again
* fixed a bug that arose if tabbar was disabled on start-up
* applied a patch from Abigail Brady that fixed some problems in ANSI color
  handling. Also fixed some other things that he discovered. KMuddy now
  conforms to the color standard defined in Ecma-048 (though only a subset
  of defined codes is supported). Thanks!
* added Scripts dialog to Profile menu

2002-12-22
* created Scripts dialog
* added run* functions to cScriptList
* added script list saving support

2002-12-14
* If you had some connection then created another but connection failed,
  a new tab with "No connection" was created but not destroyed. Fixed.
* fixed some updating of window caption
* Connect window now appears immediately after prossing Connect button,
  so that users don't think that we've crashed

2002-12-13
* implemented class cRunningScript (only integration to a list of scripts
  is missing, because that list is missing as well)
* wrote class cScriptList, that handles a list of scripts (TRIVIAL :))

2002-12-08
* implemented class cScript, that represents one script
* created a skeleton of cRunningScript class, that represents one running
  script

2002-12-06
* implemented the dlgGroups dialog, that shows and manages a list of groups
* implemented menuitems and actions for dlgGroups
* ALIAS/TRIGGER GROUPS WORK!!!
* double-clicking on an entry in Connect dialog starts the connection

2002-12-05

* aliases/triggers now contain information about their group
* aliases/triggers now only work if their group is active
* added alias/trigger groups to the profile
* it is now possible to change alias/trigger group in the Edit alias/trigger
  dialog (but there's only one group, so it isn't very usable yet...)
* Ha! Found out why the multiline kept hiding behind the main window and
  fixed it
* improved decision assistant a bit
   
2002-12-02
* RELEASED VERSION 0.3.1

2002-11-30
* prepared webpage update

* created tarballs and Mandrake RPMs, notified packagers (well, packager ;))

2002-11-29
* added option to hide the tabbar if it contains only one tab
* added IPC support to announce changes in global settings to other
  running instances of KMuddy
* spent two hours trying to get rid of one strange crash :|
  Wrote the sentence "If you change some class and nothing else
  then look in that class first even if things break down somewhere else!"
  above my computer ;(((

2002-11-28
* fixed crash when disconnecting a second+ connection (hopefully :)
* workaround for problem with QT's QTabBar, which does not emit
  selected(int) signal for the tab that gets selected after removeTab
  has been called. This makes disconnecting work properly.
* when switching between connections, inputline is activated and its
  selection restored
* fixed crash in cGlobalSettings when some sessions have been disconnected
  and preferences are applied
* action toolbar now updates correctly when switching between connections
* window now has a minimum size - workaround for the tiny window at first
  startup
* fixed crash when quitting with transcript running
  
2002-11-27
* fixed lots of problems that appeared with the switch to cSession
* KMainWindow is now used instead of simple QVBox
* Main window now remembers its position/size; the old "cols x rows"
  method is no longer used

* finished cSession support in KMuddy class
* started effort to make the whole stuff compilable

2002-11-18
* added SuSE 8.0 RPMs of KMuddy 0.3 from A.Cascio to the download page

2002-11-17
* added Andrea Cascio to the "Thanks to" page :)
* implemented cSession support in cTelnet, cSendCmd, cANSIParser,
  cCmdProcessor, cTextProcessor, cConnection, cTranscript, cConsole,
  cInputLine, cStatus, cAction, cActionList, cAlias, cAliasList,
  cConnPrefs, cGlobalSettings, cProfiles, cTriggerList,
  dlgAliasTrigger, dlgAppSettings
* partially implemented cSession management support in class KMuddy

2002-11-16
* included patch from Andrea Cascio that extends speed-walking with Up and
  Down dommands
* added object construction/preparation to cStatus. This will form the basis
of tabbed support in 0.3.1

2002-11-15
* fixed a bug with mousewheel scrolling in auxiliary console (that's the
  small window showing last few lines that pops up if you scroll the main
  console)
* fixed problem with window centering on the screen whenever
  user changes global settings
* added option not to echo commands and/or system messages
* added the Decision assistant similar to one from zMUD (it just writes
  a random sentence)
* added class cSession. It does nothing now, but it'll form the basis
  of upcoming support for multiple worlds within one instance. This will
  come in version 0.3.1
* added cSessionBase class, made it one of ancestors of every class that
  needs one instance per connection. Multiple inheritance is definitely a
  good thing :) . This class provides access to appropriate cSession object.

2002-11-10
* fixed compilation problem with gcc 2.95 (thanks to Dre)
* fixed a bug that caused history browsing with cursor keys not to work if
  "keep text" option was disabled
  
2002-11-08
* RELEASED VERSION 0.3

2002-11-08
* created an icon for KMuddy
* created Mandrake 9.0 RPM and tarball for 0.3

2002-11-07
* console size is no longer remembered between sessions. Instead, the size
  that you specify in Global settings is used for every session.
* fixed some problems with action toolbar and console resizing
* code is now ready for 0.3 release, but I'll create manual and RPMs first
* manual written :)))
* added entry for $(prefix)/lib/menu; this is only valid for Mandrake, but
  it gets installed for every distribution... File can get to some strange
  place if KDE is in /opt. Maybe i'll look at this later

2002-11-06
* problem with setting inputline colors fixed - looks like setting of colors
  of edit widgets in Qt 3.0.5 has been corrected, it now uses correct
  palette. Updated to work with both 3.0.5 and older (I think...).
* implemented class cActionList, modified class cAction
* added action list and edit action dialogs (by updating/modyfying dialogs
  for aliases and triggers)
* actions are now a part of profile
* action toolbar is automatically shown/hidden as needed
* ACTION TOOLBAR WORKS!!!
* disabled window auto-centering

2002-11-05
* I've just upgraded to mandrake9, (disabled supermount :|) and tested kmuddy
  with gcc-3.2. Incredible... Please don't report speed-related problems
  if you use older compiler.
  Also, it looks like some colors cannot be set properly now.
  I'll look at it.

2002-11-03
* tried to include toolbar and failed :(
   looks like toolbars are a bit tricky without a KMainWindow, as they don't
   resize when undocked, ending up being too small to be usable. Anyone knows
   how to fix this? (preferably without reimplementing resize event and all
   that sort of stuff...)
   I could include a non-floating toolbar, and the action toolbar is done
   like this, but I cease to do this now. Maybe later?
* implemented cAction class, that represents one button in a action toolbar
  (inherited from cSaveableField, together with cAlias and cTrigger)

2002-11-02
* Iconized the app, mostly with KDE's standard icons. They are not always
  suitable for their actions, but I had no other... I'm no artist :(((
  Maybe somebody could volunteer to draw better ones?
  
2002-11-01
* implemented Session Transcript dialog box
* finished cTranscript class
* SESSION TRANSCRIPT WORKS!
* re-enabled Report Bug... option in Help menu (found out that it's sent

* implemented most of cTranscript class, that handles session transcript
* fixed a bug in ANSI parser that sometimes caused wrong colors to be used
* fixed some bugs and strange lines in cConsole (main output screen)

* RELEASED VERSION 0.2.1

2002-10-25

  texts (e.g. help), waiting for ENTER after each page
* command history can now be browsed with UP/DOWN (last 10 commands only)

2002-10-22
* fixed a bug causing KMuddy to crash on profile disconnecting
* added a patch for 0.2 fixing this

2002-10-21

2002-10-19
* fixed another compilation issues from 0.1a - no more 0.1 releases though
* added "What's this" help to many widgets

2002-10-18
* Well, looks like 0.1a doesn't compile with gcc 2.96. Terrible.
* implemented some connection preferences
* correct quit-command is now sent by cTelnet when disconnecting
* it's now possible to disable ANSI colors
* implemented GUI for above-mentioned things

2002-10-17

  with gcc 2.95 and maybe also gcc 3.2
* released version 0.1a that (maybe) fixes that for version 0.1

2002-10-14
* implemented class cTextProcessor that proceses text after it's been
  displayed
* TRIGGERS WORK!!!
* detection of infinite trigger loop is ready and working
* alases and triggers can now be disabled

2002-10-13
* classes that handle triggers (cTrigger and cTriggerList) implemented
* GUI for triggers added (most stuff is common with aliases)
* (triggers still don't work, but they can be created/edited/tested...)

2002-10-12
* test area for aliases works
* aliases are now fully implemented

2002-09-29
* bugfix: variable expansion no longer affects the alias text

* implemented changing order of aliases/triggers
* Aliases GUI is now usable (testarea still missing...)

2002-09-26
* most of Edit alias dialog's functionality implemented (everything except
  Test area); aliases now have (partially) functional GUI!

2002-09-22
* Aliases dialog now shows a list of aliases
* designed Edit alias dialog

2002-09-15
* first dialog for alias GUI designed (but doesn't work)

2002-09-14
* aliases now must be the whole word (so that you can have single-letter
  aliases like l->look without expansion look->lookook and still be able
  to use "l at something")

2002-09-13
* added support for moving items in cSaveableList
* ALIASES WORK! (though GUI is still not available)
* implemented alias support in cCmdProcessor

2002-09-12
* some improvements in alias expansion
* implemented class cAliasList, that manipulates the aliases
* reverted from KExtendedSocket back to KSocket. KExtendedSocket does
  not work properly :(
* well, some of the problems weren't actually caused by KExtendedSocket,
  but nevertheless I still think that KSocket is better for this...

2002-09-10
* finished all functions in class cSaveableList - common stuff for aliases
  and triggers is ready (though not tested yet...)
* implemented class cAlias, which represents one alias

2002-09-09
* wrote double-linked list routines in cSaveableList

2002-09-08
* some modifications/addons to cSaveableField (incl. pseudo-variables
  support)
* wrote header file of abstract cSaveableList class
  (manages cSaveableField items; derived classes will manage
  aliases/triggers)

2002-09-07
* wrote abstract class cSaveableField; alias/trigger objects will be
  derived
  from this; text comparison is here (substring, regexp and friends)

2002-09-06
* merged cConnection fix with 0.1 release

2002-09-05
* Fixed auto-login in cConnection class - should no longer crash/hang
